Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and its global 
burden has more than doubled over the past 25 years. The highest incidence 
regions for pancreatic cancer include North America, Europe and Australia, and 
although much of this increase is due to ageing worldwide populations, there are 
key modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer such as cigarette smoking, 
obesity, diabetes and alcohol intake. The prevalence of these risk factors is 
increasing in many global regions, resulting in increasing age-adjusted 
incidence rates for pancreatic cancer, but the relative contribution from these 
risk factors varies globally due to variation in the underlying prevalence and 
prevention strategies. Inherited genetic factors, although not directly 
modifiable, are an important component of pancreatic cancer risk, and include 
pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer genes, genes associated with hereditary 
pancreatitis, as well as common variants identified in genome-wide association 
studies. Identification of the genetic changes that underlie pancreatic cancer 
not only provides insight into the aetiology of this cancer but also provides an 
opportunity to guide early detection strategies. The goal of this Review is to 
provide an up-to-date overview of the established modifiable and inherited risk 
factors for pancreatic cancer.

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the biology of 
pancreatic cancer, and advances in patients' management have also taken place. 
Evidence is beginning to show that screening first-degree relatives of 
individuals with several family members affected by pancreatic cancer can 
identify non-invasive precursors of this malignant disease. The incidence of and 
number of deaths caused by pancreatic tumours have been gradually rising, even 
as incidence and mortality of other common cancers have been declining. Despite 
developments in detection and management of pancreatic cancer, only about 4% of 
patients will live 5 years after diagnosis. Survival is better for those with 
malignant disease localised to the pancreas, because surgical resection at 
present offers the only chance of cure. Unfortunately, 80-85% of patients 
present with advanced unresectable disease. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer 
responds poorly to most chemotherapeutic agents. Hence, we need to understand 
the biological mechanisms that contribute to development and progression of 
pancreatic tumours. In this Seminar we will discuss the most common and deadly 
form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

This review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on factors, diagnosis, and 
treatment of pancreatic cancer, and aims to promote further research on this 
under-studied malignant tumor. At present, we urgently need to identify 
high-risk patients with precancerous diseases through screening approaches, so 
that medical professionals and the general public may better understand 
prevention strategies or early detection measures. Pancreatic cancer is a highly 
invasive malignant tumor with a fatal risk, mainly seen in men and older adults 
(60-85 years old). Pancreatic cancer is now increasingly observed in young 
patients. Because the disease has no early symptoms and can quickly invade 
surrounding tissues and organs, it is one of the deadliest cancers. With a view 
to identify the important factors for the development of pancreatic cancer, 
previous studies have found that smoking, alcohol, and chronic pancreatitis are 
considered high-risk factors. Recent studies have shown that abnormal metabolism 
of human microorganisms, blood type, and glucose and lipid levels are also 
important factors in the development of pancreatic cancer. Identifying early 
diagnosis options is an important way to improve detection and survival rates of 
pancreatic cancer. None of the many tumor markers associated with pancreatic 
cancer are highly specific, which also indicates further research is required to 
improve the early detection rate. Future directions in terms of treatment 
evaluating the relationship between the microbiology-free system and 
immunotherapy will bring a major breakthrough and is expected to bring exciting 
clinical applications in improving the life-cycle of pancreatic cancer patients.

Pancreatic cancer usually results in poor survival with limited options for 
treatment, as most affected individuals present with advanced disease. Early 
detection of preinvasive pancreatic neoplasia and identifying molecular 
therapeutic targets provide opportunities for extending survival. Although 
screening for pancreatic cancer is currently not recommended for the general 
population, emerging evidence indicates that pancreatic surveillance can improve 
outcomes for individuals in certain high-risk groups. Changes in the 
epidemiology of pancreatic cancer, experience from pancreatic surveillance, and 
discovery of novel biomarkers provide a roadmap for new strategies for 
pancreatic cancer risk assessment, early detection, and prevention.

Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancies which is predominantly seen in men and 
at advanced age (40-85 years) and has an aggressive course. Its frequency is 
gradually increasing over the past years. It accounts for 2% of all cancers and 
5% of cancer-related deaths. Pancreatic cancer takes the first place among 
asymptomatic cancers. Ninety percent of cases are adenocarcinomas. Ten percent 
of the patients have a familial disposition. The disease is very difficult to 
detect as it has no early signs and spreads rapidly to surrounding organs is one 
of the most deadly types of cancer. Pancreatic cancer may result from hereditary 
germline or somatic acquired mutations in cancer-related genes and mutations 
also cause cancer progression and metastasis.

Cancer of the pancreas remains one of the deadliest cancer types. Based on the 
GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates, pancreatic cancer causes more than 331000 deaths per 
year, ranking as the seventh leading cause of cancer death in both sexes 
together. Globally, about 338000 people had pancreatic cancer in 2012, making it 
the 11th most common cancer. The highest incidence and mortality rates of 
pancreatic cancer are found in developed countries. Trends for pancreatic cancer 
incidence and mortality varied considerably in the world. A known cause of 
pancreatic cancer is tobacco smoking. This risk factor is likely to explain some 
of the international variations and gender differences. The overall five-year 
survival rate is about 6% (ranges from 2% to 9%), but this vary very small 
between developed and developing countries. To date, the causes of pancreatic 
cancer are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been 
identified, such as smoking, obesity, genetics, diabetes, diet, inactivity. 
There are no current screening recommendations for pancreatic cancer, so primary 
prevention is of utmost importance. A better understanding of the etiology and 
identifying the risk factors is essential for the primary prevention of this 
disease.

Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy with poor prognosis and high mortality. The 
recent increase in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality has resulted in an 
increased number of studies on its epidemiology. This comprehensive and 
systematic literature review summarizes the advances in the epidemiology of 
pancreatic cancer, including its epidemiological trends, risk factors, risk 
prediction models, screening modalities, and prognosis. The risk factors for 
pancreatic cancers can be categorized as those related to individual 
characteristics, lifestyle and environment, and disease status. Several 
prediction models for pancreatic cancer have been developed in populations with 
new-onset diabetes or a family history of pancreatic cancer; however, these 
models require further validation. Despite recent progress in pancreatic cancer 
screening, the quantity and quality of related studies are also unsatisfactory, 
especially with respect to the identification of high-risk populations and 
development of effective screening modality. Apart from the populations with 
familial genetic risk and those at a high risk of sporadic pancreatic cancer, 
risk factors such as new-onset diabetes may be a new direction for timely 
intervention. We hope this work will provide new ideas for further prevention 
and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need to detect pancreatic cancer in an earlier stage to improve outcomes. 
A variety of hereditary cancer syndromes have been associated with an increased 
risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and these individuals may benefit from 
surveillance programs. Surveillance programs have shown potential to improve 
outcomes, but have important risks such as overtreatment. In this review we will 
discuss the definitions and epidemiology of hereditary pancreatic cancer, 
recommendations for genetic testing and participation in surveillance. Important 
aspects are differences in surveillance strategies, target lesions, and 
potential benefits and harms of surveillance. Lastly we will highlight future 
directions for research and improvement of care for individuals at high-risk of 
pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is one of our most lethal malignancies. Despite substantial 
improvements in the survival rates for other major cancer forms, pancreatic 
cancer survival rates have remained relatively unchanged since the 1960s. 
Pancreatic cancer is usually detected at an advanced stage and most treatment 
regimens are ineffective, contributing to the poor overall prognosis. Herein, we 
review the current understanding of pancreatic cancer, focusing on central 
aspects of disease management from radiology, surgery and pathology to oncology.

Pancreatic cancer is currently one of the most lethal diseases. In recent years, 
increasing evidence has shown that reprogrammed metabolism may play a critical 
role in the carcinogenesis, progression, treatment and prognosis of pancreatic 
cancer. Affected by internal or external factors, pancreatic cancer cells adopt 
extensively distinct metabolic processes to meet their demand for growth. 
Rewired glucose, amino acid and lipid metabolism and metabolic crosstalk within 
the tumor microenvironment contribute to unlimited pancreatic tumor progression. 
In addition, the metabolic reprogramming involved in pancreatic cancer 
resistance is also closely related to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and 
immunotherapy, and results in a poor prognosis. Reflective of the key role of 
metabolism, the number of preclinical and clinical trials about 
metabolism-targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer is increasing. The poor 
prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients might be largely improved after 
employing therapies that regulate metabolism. Thus, investigations of metabolism 
not only benefit the understanding of carcinogenesis and cancer progression but 
also provide new insights for treatments against pancreatic cancer.

Diagnosis and Detection of Pancreatic Cancer.

Chu LC, Goggins MG, Fishman EK.

Computed tomography is the first-line imaging modality for suspected pancreatic 
cancer. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a second-line modality 
for suspected pancreatic cancer and is usually reserved for equivocal cases. 
Both computed tomography and MR are highly sensitive in the detection of 
pancreatic cancer, with up to 96% and 93.5% sensitivity, respectively. Computed 
tomography is superior to MR in the assessment of tumor resectability, with 
accuracy rates of up to 86.8% and 78.9%, respectively. Close attention to 
secondary signs of pancreatic cancer, such as pancreatic duct dilatation, abrupt 
pancreatic duct caliber change, and parenchymal atrophy, are critical in the 
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Emerging techniques such as radiomics and 
molecular imaging have the potential of identifying malignant precursors and 
lead to earlier disease diagnosis. The results of these promising techniques 
need to be validated in larger clinical studies.

Outcomes for pancreatic cancer are becoming less discouraging with the 
refinement of molecular profiling, both germline and somatic, and beneficial 
effects seen with adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic 
Adenocarcinoma reflect these advances, and recommend that clinicians consider 
germline testing for all patients with pancreatic cancer and consider a 
molecular analysis for those with metastatic disease. The guidelines further 
recommend that clinicians consider adjuvant therapy with modified FOLFIRINOX 
(leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin) for patients who are able to tolerate 
it.

Two areas that remain the focus of improvement in pancreatic cancer include high 
post-operative morbidity and inability to uniformly translate surgical success 
into long-term survival. This narrative review addresses specific aspects of 
pancreatic cancer surgery, including neoadjuvant therapy, vascular resections, 
extended pancreatectomy, extent of lymphadenectomy and current status of 
minimally invasive surgery. R0 resection confers longer disease-free survival 
and overall survival. Vascular and adjacent organ resections should be 
undertaken after neoadjuvant therapy, only if R0 resection can be ensured based 
on high-quality preoperative imaging, and that too, with acceptable 
post-operative morbidity. Extended lymphadenectomy does not offer any advantage 
over standard lymphadenectomy. Although minimally invasive distal 
pancreatectomies offers some short-term benefits over open distal 
pancreatectomy, safety remains a concern with minimally invasive 
pancreatoduodenectomy. Strict adherence to principles and judicious utilization 
of surgery within a multimodality framework is the way forward.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Two main areas of focus in pancreatic 
cancer research are the high rates of post-surgery complications and poor 
survival despite completely removing the tumor. Complete, margin-negative 
resection (where some healthy tissue is removed to ensure the whole tumor is cut 
out) is the only way to ensure long-term survival. However, such extensive 
resections, especially when they involve nearby blood vessels and/or organs, 
should only be undertaken if the imaging done pre-surgery indicates the 
possibility that a complete, margin-negative resection can be achieved. It 
should be noted that the removal of lymph nodes, in addition to the ones 
normally removed during a pancreatic resection, does not confer a survival 
benefit. Distal pancreatectomy (performed for tumors involving the body or tail 
of the pancreas) is safe and feasible using minimal access methods; however, the 
safety of minimally-invasive pancreatoduodenectomy (performed for tumors of the 
head of the pancreas) remains to be proven. The oncological benefit of 
minimally-invasive distal pancreatectomy over open surgery has not been 
established.

Pancreatic cancer is a rapidly progressing disease with a poor prognosis. We 
still have many questions about the pathogenesis, early diagnosis and precise 
treatment of this disease. Organoids, a rapidly emerging technology, can 
simulate the characteristics of pancreatic tumors. Using the organoid model of 
pancreatic cancer, we can study and explore the characteristics of pancreatic 
cancer, thereby effectively guiding clinical practice and improving patient 
prognosis. This review introduces the development of organoids, comparisons of 
organoids with other preclinical models and the status of organoids in basic 
research and clinical applications for pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal condition with a rising incidence and often 
presents at an advanced stage, contributing to abysmal five-year survival rates. 
Unspecific symptoms and the current lack of biomarkers and screening tools 
hamper early diagnosis. New technologies for liquid biopsies and their 
respective evaluation in pancreatic cancer patients have emerged over recent 
years. The term liquid biopsy summarizes the sampling and analysis of 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), and tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) from body fluids. The major advantages of liquid biopsies rely on 
their minimal invasiveness and repeatability, allowing serial sampling for 
dynamic insights to aid diagnosis, particularly early detection, risk 
stratification, and precision medicine in pancreatic cancer. However, liquid 
biopsies have not yet developed into a new pillar for clinicians' routine 
armamentarium. Here, we summarize recent findings on the use of liquid biopsy in 
pancreatic cancer patients. We discuss current challenges and future 
perspectives of this potentially powerful alternative to conventional tissue 
biopsies.

Pancreatic cancer is an increasingly growing source of cancer-related deaths and 
is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Its treatment is difficult because of the 
poor results of conventional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiotherapy. Microbiota and their products can regulate the microenvironment of 
pancreatic tumors, the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells, and the 
functionality of the immune system. Promising results have been achieved in 
treating pancreatic cancer by regulating microbiota. However, intratumoral 
microbiota is still in its infancy as a new field of discovery for pancreatic 
cancer. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which intratumoral microbiota 
causes pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis and 
demonstrates their significant potential in diagnosing and treating pancreatic 
cancer. Additionally, we present an outlook on the future of intratumoral 
microbiota in treating pancreatic cancer.

Familial Pancreatic Cancer.

Benzel J, Fendrich V.

Familial pancreatic cancer accounts for 10% of all patients with pancreatic 
cancer. Because the 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is only 7%, 
screening programs for high-risk individuals are essential and might be 
advantageous. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mostly shows symptoms at an 
advanced state and treatment is not efficient enough to cure most patients. 
People with hereditary tumor syndromes or their affected relatives can also be 
included in such screening programs. Besides the collection of data to 
investigate the background of the disease, these screening programs aim to 
diagnose and treat precursor lesions so that more dangerous, invasive lesions 
are prevented. These precursor lesions can be pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, and mucinous cystic 
neoplasm. This review summarizes the latest knowledge of pancreatic screening 
programs, shows the procedure of pancreatic cancer screening, and gives an 
overview of current guidelines.

[Exocrine pancreatic cancer - what is new in the update of the S3 guideline?].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Seufferlein T(1), Kestler A(1).

Author information:
(1)Klinik für Innere Medizin I, Universitätsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

In 2020, worldwide 495,773 people were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma and 466,003 patients died from pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic 
cancer ranks 13th among cancer diagnosis and is the 7th most common cause of 
cancer-related deaths 1.In Germany, each year approximately 10,000 people 
develop pancreatic cancer and around the same number of patients die from this 
disease 2. The relative 5-year survival rate is only 10%. The majority of 
patients die within the year of diagnosis.Incidence and mortality of pancreatic 
cancer have continuously increased over the recent years. There are multiple 
reasons for this finding: pancreatic cancer occurs more frequently in older 
patients which leads to a higher incidence in an aging society. There are no 
effective screening and early detection measures for sporadic pancreatic cancer. 
Therefore, the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage where the 
tumor is no longer amenable to curative treatment. Furthermore, the majority of 
pancreatic cancers is per se likely to constitute a disseminated disease, even 
if initial imaging suggests a localized, surgically amenable disease. This is 
reflected by the high rate of early metastases and the small number of patients 
with long-term survival after surgery with curative intent.The S3 guideline 
exocrine pancreatic cancer aims to present the available evidence on 
epidemiology, molecular alterations, diagnostics, surgical and non-surgical 
treatment as well as palliative measures in order to support all those involved 
in the treatment of this tumor and to improve the care of patients.To better 
address this need, the S3 guideline was updated again in 2022 and also changed 
to a living guideline with regular updates to further improve the timeliness of 
the guideline.

Publisher: FAMILIäRE BELASTUNG: Definition der Zielgruppe, der genetische 
Untersuchungen zur Abklärung eines erhöhten Pankreaskarzinomrisikos angeboten 
werden soll. PRäOPERATIVE AUSBREITUNGSDIAGNOSTIK: Bei einem potenziell 
resektablen Pankreaskarzinom soll zusätzlich zu einer Dünnschicht-CT sowie zum 
Ausschluss von Lebermetastasen eine Leber-MRT oder alternativ eine FDG-PET-CT 
durchgeführt werden.
CHIRURGISCHE THERAPIE: Die rein anatomischen Kriterien hinsichtlich der 
Resektabilität eines Pankreaskarzinoms werden um biologische Faktoren (z.B. 
CA19–9-Wert) und den körperlichen Allgemeinzustand (ECOG) erweitert. Es besteht 
ein Zusammenhang zwischen der Zahl an Pankreasresektionen an einer Institution 
und der Letalität, sodass erstmals eine Mindestfallzahl von ≥ 20 
Pankreasresektionen für ein Zentrum empfohlen wird.
ADJUVANTE UND NEOADJUVANTE NICHT CHIRURGISCHE THERAPIE: Aktuell wird bei gutem 
ECOG-Performance-Status eine adjuvante Therapie mit mFOLFIRINOX empfohlen. Eine 
neoadjuvante Therapie wird bei einem grenzwertig (borderline) resektablen 
Pankreaskarzinom empfohlen. Falls das Pankreaskarzinom als lokal fortgeschritten 
eingeschätzt wird, soll eine initiale Chemotherapie erfolgen. In beiden Fällen 
(borderline und lokal fortgeschrittenen Tumoren) wird bei stabiler Erkrankung 
eine chirurgische Exploration empfohlen.
PALLIATIVE THERAPIE DES PANKREASKARZINOMS: Vor allem Patient*innen mit einer 
guten körperlichen Leistungsfähigkeit profitieren von einer 
Kombinationschemotherapie.
THERAPIESTRATEGIEN IN MOLEKULAREN SUBGRUPPEN: Bei Nachweis einer 
BRCA1/2-Keimbahnmutation sollten Patient*innen eine platinhaltige 
Kombinationschemotherapie erhalten und können von einer Erhaltungstherapie mit 
einem PARP-Inhibitor profitieren. Fitten Patient*innen sollte bei Progress des 
Tumors eine Zweitlinientherapie angeboten werden. Eine Strahlentherapie, 
alleinige Radiotherapie oder Radiochemotherapie kann bei lokal fortgeschrittenem 
Pankreaskarzinom ohne Hinweis auf Fernmetastasen angeboten werden.

Despite the many advances reported during the past year, pancreatic cancer 
remains a profound therapeutic challenge. Helical CT has become the preferred 
staging study at many institutions. The role of chemoradiation therapy in a 
preoperative and postoperative setting is being defined. Gemcitabine has become 
first-line therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is 
hoped that the increasing knowledge of the molecular biology of pancreatic 
carcinoma will lead to improvements in diagnosing, staging, and treating 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

INTRODUCTION: Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced stage, 
incurable disease. However, patients with high-grade precancerous lesions and 
many patients with low-stage disease can be cured with surgery, suggesting that 
early detection has the potential to improve survival. While serum CA19.9 has 
been a long-standing biomarker used for pancreatic cancer disease monitoring, 
its low sensitivity and poor specificity have driven investigators to hunt for 
better diagnostic markers.
AREAS COVERED: This review will cover recent advances in genetics, proteomics, 
imaging, and artificial intelligence, which offer opportunities for the early 
detection of curable pancreatic neoplasms.
EXPERT OPINION: From exosomes, to circulating tumor DNA, to subtle changes on 
imaging, we know much more now about the biology and clinical manifestations of 
early pancreatic neoplasia than we did just five years ago. The overriding 
challenge, however, remains the development of a practical approach to screen 
for a relatively rare, but deadly, disease that is often treated with complex 
surgery. It is our hope that future advances will bring us closer to an 
effective and financially sound approach for the early detection of pancreatic 
cancer and its precursors.

Despite the advancements made in oncology in recent years, the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer remains a challenge. Five-year survival rates for this cancer 
do not exceed 10%. Among the reasons contributing to poor treatment outcomes are 
the oligosymptomatic course of the tumor, diagnostic difficulties due to the 
anatomical location of the organ, and the unique biological features of 
pancreatic cancer. The mainstay of treatment for resectable cancer is surgery 
and adjuvant chemotherapy. For unresectable and metastatic cancers, chemotherapy 
remains the primary method of treatment. At the same time, for about thirty 
years, there have been attempts to improve treatment outcomes by using 
radiotherapy combined with systemic treatment. Unlike chemotherapy, radiotherapy 
has no established place in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This paper 
addresses the topic of radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer as a valuable method 
that can improve treatment outcomes alongside chemotherapy.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers with extremely high 
mortality rate, and the number of cases is expected to steadily increase with 
time. Pancreatic cancer is refractory to conventional cancer treatment options, 
like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and commercialized immunotherapeutics, owing 
to its immunosuppressive and desmoplastic phenotype. Due to these reasons, 
development of an innovative treatment option that can overcome these challenges 
posed by the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME) is in an urgent need. The 
present review aims to summarize the evolution of oncolytic adenovirus (oAd) 
engineering and usage as therapeutics (either monotherapy or combination 
therapy) over the last decade to overcome these hurdles to instigate a potent 
antitumor effect against desmoplastic and immunosuppressive pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest solid tumors in humans and an 
unsolved problem of today's medicine. Experimental studies reveal that the 
heterogeneous and complex pancreatic cancer microenvironment is responsible, not 
only for cancer growth, spread, development of metastases, but also for cancer 
recurrence and chemotherapy resistance. Chemotherapy affecting the cancer stroma 
is still under clinical and experimental research and remains hope for cure of 
pancreatic cancer. We present the cancer microenvironment characteristics and 
summary of experimental studies with use of agents affecting pancreatic cancer 
stroma.

BACKGROUND: Today, the pancreatic cancer prognosis is poor and genetic 
technology is developing to treat various types of cancers. Scientists are 
actively looking for a new technique to design a therapeutic strategy to treat 
pancreatic cancer. Several oncolytic viruses are known to be valuable tools for 
pancreatic cancer treatment. Recent Studies demonstrate their effectiveness and 
safety in various administration routes such as direct intratumoral, 
intracutaneous, intravascular, and other routes.
METHOD: In this study, all studies conducted in the past 20 years have been 
reviewed. Reputable scientific databases including Irandoc, Scopus, Google 
Scholar and PubMed, are searched for the keywords of Pancreatic cancer, 
oncolytic, viruses and treatment and the latest information about them is 
obtained.
RESULTS: Engineering the oncolytic viruses' genome and insertion of intended 
transgenes including cytokines or shRNAs, has caused promising promotions in 
pancreatic cancer treatment. Some oncolytic viruses inhibit tumors directly and 
some through activation of immune responses.
CONCLUSION: This approach showed some signs of success in efficiency like immune 
system activation in the tumor environment, effective virus targeting in the 
tumor cells by systemic administration, and enhanced patient survival in 
comparison with the control group. But of course, until now, using these 
oncolytic viruses alone has not been effective in elimination of tumors.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to be the second leading 
cause of cancer death in the US by 2030. There are multiple germline pathogenic 
variants and cancer syndromes associated with an increased risk of PDAC. 
Precision treatment, informed by germline genetic testing and molecular tumor 
analysis, can optimize therapeutic regimens and outcomes for those diagnosed 
with PDAC. As a result, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently 
recommends genetic testing for all newly diagnosed PDAC patients given the 
clinical implications for treatment but also for the identification of at-risk 
family members who can benefit from pancreatic cancer screening and other cancer 
prevention strategies. This article reviews inherited risk factors for the 
development of PDAC and current screening strategies for the early detection of 
PDAC in high-risk populations.

Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas remains a challenging disease mainly due to 
advanced stage diagnosis, the early systemic dissemination, aggressive local 
tumor progression, and subsequent short patient survival. Thus, assessment of 
incidence markers instead of prevalence indicators is recommended because the 
time between diagnosis and death is usually very short. Investigations to date 
have led to the discovery of many rare genes and environmental factors that 
contribute to pancreatic cancer. However, common genes involved in genetic 
polymorphisms, and specific risk factors have not been identified. Furthermore, 
the role of gene-environment interactions on the tumorogenesis and progression 
of pancreatic cancer need to be further investigated. Given current therapeutic 
modalities, only early detection of cancer of the pancreas, followed by surgical 
resection, offers the possibility of lengthening survival time.

Familial pancreatic cancer--status quo.

INTRODUCTION: Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is defined by families with at 
least two first-degree relatives with confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) that do not fulfill the criteria of other inherited tumor syndromes with 
an increased risk for the development of PDAC, such as hereditary pancreatitis 
or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. FPC is mostly autosomal dominant 
inherited and presents with a heterogeneous phenotype. Although the major gene 
defect has not yet been identified, some important germline mutations in the 
BRCA2-, PALB2-, and ATM-genes are causative in some FPC families.
FPC SCREENING: It is suggested by experts to include high-risk individuals in a 
screening program with a multidisciplinary approach under research protocol 
conditions. However, neither biomarkers nor reliable imaging modalities for the 
detection of high-grade precursor lesions are yet available. Most screening 
programs are currently based on endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance 
imaging, and first data demonstrated that precursor lesions (pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) of PDAC can 
be identified. Timing and extent of surgery are still a matter of debate.
SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: The present review focuses on the clinical phenotype of 
FPC, its histopathological characteristics, known underlying genetic changes, 
genetic counseling, and screening.

Up to 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer have a family history of the 
disease. Familial pancreatic cancer is defined as at least two first-degree 
relatives with pancreatic cancer that occurs without being part of a cancer 
syndrome. Although this does not follow a specific Mendelian pattern of 
inheritance, research is underway to better understand this cohort of patients. 
Recent expert opinion/recommendations encourage physicians treating patients 
with pancreatic cancer to ask them to consider having germline testing. Herein, 
we summarize the current peer-reviewed literature on the most common syndromes 
associated with pancreatic cancer, associated genetic mutations, and 
recommendations from various consortia regarding screening strategies. Lastly, 
we describe the economic impact of pancreatic cancer and the impact of screening 
tools in high-risk populations.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with exceptionally high 
mortality. Despite the relatively low incidence rate (10th), it is the fourth 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in most developed countries. To improve 
the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and strengthen the standardized 
comprehensive treatment are still the main focus of pancreatic cancer research. 
Here, we summarized the rapid developments in the diagnosis and treatments of 
pancreatic cancer. Regarding diagnosis, we reviewed advances in medical imaging 
technology, tumor markers, molecular biology (e.g., gene mutation), and 
proteomics. Moreover, great progress has also been made in the treatments of 
this disease, including surgical resection, chemotherapy, targeted radiotherapy, 
targeted minimally invasive treatment, and molecular targeted therapy. 
Therefore, we also recapitulated the development, advantages, and disadvantages 
of each of the treatment methods in this review.

While great strides in improving survival rates have been made for most cancers 
in recent years, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the 
solid tumors with the worst prognosis. PDAC mortality often overlaps with 
incidence. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment, but it 
can be performed in a very limited number of cases. In order to improve the 
prognosis of PDAC, there are ideally two possible ways: the discovery of new 
strategies or drugs that will make it possible to treat the tumor more 
successfully or an earlier diagnosis that will allow patients to be operated on 
at a less advanced stage. The aim of this review was to summarize all the 
possible strategies available today for the early diagnosis of PDAC and the 
paths that research needs to take to make this goal ever closer. All the most 
recent studies on risk factors and screening modalities, new laboratory tests 
including liquid biopsy, new imaging methods and possible applications of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning were reviewed and commented on. 
Unfortunately, in 2022 the results for this type of cancer still remain 
discouraging, while a catastrophic increase in cases is expected in the coming 
years. The article was also written with the aim of highlighting the urgency of 
devoting more attention and resources to this pathology in order to reach a 
solution that seems more and more unreachable every day.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic 
cancer, remains one of the highly lethal malignancies. The highly refractory 
nature of clinically advanced disease and lack of a reliable biomarker for early 
detection are major obstructions in improving patient outcome. The recent 
efforts, however, in understanding the pancreatic tumor biology have resulted in 
the recognition of novel addictions as well as vulnerabilities of tumor cells 
and are being assessed for their clinical potential. This special issue 
highlights some of the recent progress, complexity and challenges towards 
improving disease outcome in patients with this lethal malignancy.

Proteome-based biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.

Sun C, Rosendahl AH, Ansari D, Andersson R.

Pancreatic cancer, as a highly malignant cancer and the fourth cause of 
cancer-related death in world, is characterized by dismal prognosis, due to 
rapid disease progression, highly invasive tumour phenotype, and resistance to 
chemotherapy. Despite significant advances in treatment of the disease during 
the past decade, the survival rate is little improved. A contributory factor to 
the poor outcome is the lack of appropriate sensitive and specific biomarkers 
for early diagnosis. Furthermore, biomarkers for targeting, directing and 
assessing therapeutic intervention, as well as for detection of residual or 
recurrent cancer are also needed. Thus, the identification of adequate 
biomarkers in pancreatic cancer is of extreme importance. Recently, accompanying 
the development of proteomic technology and devices, more and more potential 
biomarkers have appeared and are being reported. In this review, we provide an 
overview of the role of proteome-based biomarkers in pancreatic cancer, 
including tissue, serum, juice, urine and cell lines. We also discuss the 
possible mechanism and prospects in the future. That information hopefully might 
be helpful for further research in the field.

INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has an extremely poor prognosis, even with 
surgical resection and triplet chemotherapy treatment. Cancer immunotherapy has 
been recently approved for tumor-agnostic treatment with genome analysis, 
including in PC. However, it has limited efficacy.
AREAS COVERED: In addition to the low tumor mutation burden, one of the 
difficulties of immunotherapy in PC is the presence of abundant stromal cells in 
its microenvironment. Among stromal cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) 
play a major role in immunotherapy resistance, and CAF-targeted therapies are 
currently under development, including those in combination with 
immunotherapies. Meanwhile, microbiomes and tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) have 
been shown to alter the behavior of distant receptor cells in PC. This review 
discusses the role of CAFs, microbiomes, and TDEs in PC tumor immunity.
EXPERT OPINION: Elucidating the mechanisms by which CAFs, microbiomes, and TDEs 
are involved in the tumorigenesis of PC will be helpful for developing novel 
immunotherapeutic strategies and identifying companion biomarkers for 
immunotherapy. Spatial single-cell analysis of the tumor microenvironment will 
be useful for identifying biomarkers of PC immunity. Furthermore, given the 
complexity of immune mechanisms, artificial intelligence models will be 
beneficial for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered one of the deadliest human 
cancers, with 1-5% 5-year survival rates (~6-month median survival duration) 
despite therapy; thus, PDAC represents an unmet therapeutic challenge. PDAC is 
the major histological subtype, comprising 90% of all pancreatic cancers. It is 
a highly complex and aggressive malignancy, presenting with early local invasion 
and metastasis, and is resistant to most therapies, all of which are believed to 
contribute to its extremely poor prognosis. PDAC is characterized by molecular 
alterations, including mutations of K-RAS (~90% of cases), TP53, transforming 
growth factor-β, Hedgehog, WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways. Given that cancer 
stem cells have a crucial role not only in tumor initiation and progression, but 
also in drug resistance and relapse or recurrence of various cancer types, they 
may be excellent targets for effective novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we 
reviewed recent therapeutic strategies targeting pancreatic cancer stem cells 
using chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs, non-coding RNAs (i.e., siRNA and 
miRNAs), immunotherapy, and natural compounds.

Pancreatic cancer remains a significant public health problem with an 
ever-rising incidence of disease. Cancers of the pancreas are characterised by 
various molecular aberrations, including changes in the proteomics and genomics 
landscape of the tumour cells. Therefore, there is a need to identify the 
proteomic landscape of pancreatic cancer and the specific genomic and molecular 
alterations associated with disease subtypes. Here, we carry out an integrative 
bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, including proteomics 
and whole-exome sequencing data collected from pancreatic cancer patients. We 
apply unsupervised clustering on the proteomics dataset to reveal the two 
distinct subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Using functional and pathway analysis 
based on the proteomics data, we demonstrate the different molecular processes 
and signalling aberrations of the pancreatic cancer subtypes. In addition, we 
explore the clinical characteristics of these subtypes to show differences in 
disease outcome. Using datasets of mutations and copy number alterations, we 
show that various signalling pathways previously associated with pancreatic 
cancer are altered among both subtypes of pancreatic tumours, including the Wnt 
pathway, Notch pathway and PI3K-mTOR pathways. Altogether, we reveal the 
proteogenomic landscape of pancreatic cancer subtypes and the altered molecular 
processes that can be leveraged to devise more effective treatments.

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease, with a mortality rate almost 
identical with its incidence. Late diagnosis and limited therapeutic options 
make early detection of pancreatic cancer a pressing clinical problem. In this 
context, the investigation of the pancreatic cancer proteome has recently gained 
considerable attention because profiles of proteins may be able to more 
accurately identify disease states, such as cancer. Recent pancreatic cancer 
proteome studies may be categorized into basic studies cataloguing the 
pancreatic proteome, studies investigating differential protein expression 
patterns, and studies searching for proteome-based biomarkers for early cancer 
detection and differentiation. Although these studies clearly demonstrate that a 
range of biological samples are suitable for proteomic analyses, comparison of 
different studies is problematic due to the diversity of methodologies, sample 
sources, and characterization of patient populations. Reproducibility between 
studies has rarely been investigated, and no investigation has compared the 
different methods of proteomic research. The results of this review have shown 
that more stringent requirements concerning the design and the analysis of 
future studies should be implemented. These include an adequate patient number, 
obligatory histological examination of tissues, appropriate control groups, 
identification of proteins and peaks, validation of differential expression 
using independent cohorts and/or a second methodology, and, finally, 
demonstration of result reproducibility. This will hopefully lead to the 
discovery of prognostic and predictive biomarkers that help to improve prognosis 
of pancreatic cancer patients.

Patients with pancreatic cancer have an abysmal survival rate. The poor 
prognosis of pancreatic cancer is due to the difficulty of making an early 
diagnosis, high rate of metastasis, and frequent chemoresistance. In recent 
years, as a self-regulatory procedure within cells, the effect and mechanism of 
autophagy have been explored. Dysregulated autophagy serves as a double-edged 
sword in cancer development in which autophagy inhibits cancer initiation but 
promotes cancer progression. After tumor formation, activation of autophagy can 
induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition, regulate metabolism, specifically 
glutamine usage and the glycolytic process, and mediate drug resistance in 
pancreatic cancer. Multiple genes, RNA molecules, proteins, and certain drugs 
exert antitumor effects by inhibiting autophagy-mediated drug resistance. 
Several clinical trials have combined autophagy inhibitors with chemotherapeutic 
drugs in pancreatic cancer treatment, some of which have shown promising 
results. In conclusion, autophagy plays a vital role in pancreatic cancer 
progression and deserves further study.

The presence of pancreatic cancer during childhood is extremely rare, and 
physicians may be tempted to overlook this diagnosis based on age criteria. 
However, there are primary malignant pancreatic tumors encountered in pediatric 
patients, such as pancreatoblastoma, and tumors considered benign in general but 
may present a malignant potential, such as the solid pseudo-papillary tumor, 
insulinoma, gastrinoma, and vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting tumor. Their 
early diagnosis and management are of paramount importance since the survival 
rates tend to differ for various types of these conditions. Many pediatric 
cancers may present pancreatic metastases, such as renal cell carcinoma, which 
may evolve with pancreatic metastatic disease even after two or more decades. 
Several childhood diseases may create a predisposition for the development of 
pancreatic cancer during adulthood; hence, there is a need for extensive 
screening strategies and complex programs to facilitate the transition from 
pediatric to adult healthcare. Nevertheless, genetic studies highlight the fact 
the specific gene mutations and family aggregations may be correlated with a 
special predisposition towards pancreatic cancer. This review aims to report the 
main pancreatic cancers diagnosed during childhood, the most important childhood 
diseases predisposing to the development of pancreatic malignancies, and the 
gene mutations associates with pancreatic malignant tumors.

Cancer is currently one of the most important public health problems in the 
world. Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease with poor prognosis. As in most 
other countries, the health burden of pancreatic cancer in China is increasing, 
with annual mortality rates almost equal to incidence rates. The increasing 
trend of pancreatic cancer incidence is more significant in the rural areas than 
in the urban areas. Annual diagnoses and deaths of pancreatic cancer in China 
are now beyond the number of cases in the United States. GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates 
that cases in China account for 19.45% (65727/337872) of all newly diagnosed 
pancreatic cancer and 19.27% (63662/330391) of all deaths from pancreatic cancer 
worldwide. The population's growing socioeconomic status contributes to the 
rapid increase of China's proportional contribution to global rates. Here, we 
present an overview of control programs for pancreatic cancer in China focusing 
on prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we describe key 
epidemiological, demographic, and socioeconomic differences between China and 
developed countries. Facts including no nationwide screening program for 
pancreatic cancer, delay in early detection resulting in a late stage at 
presentation, lack of awareness of pancreatic cancer in the Chinese population, 
and low investment compared with other cancer types by government have led to 
backwardness in China's pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, we 
suggest measures to improve health outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients in 
China.
