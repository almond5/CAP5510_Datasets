Abstract
"Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is a subtype of pancreatic cancer with a poorer prognosis than pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC). The pathogenesis of this histological subtype has not been fully explained due to its rarity. Of the 245 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer, six (2.3%) were diagnosed with PASC. They were retrospectively allocated to Group A (≥ 50% adenocarcinoma components) or Group S (≥ 50% squamous cell carcinoma components). The six patients with PASC were all males between the ages of 63 and 77 years, with tumors of 12 to 52 mm in diameter. Tumors were located in the pancreatic head (n = 2) and the pancreatic tail (n = 4). Relative to Group A, all three patients in Group S had larger tumors diameters, ≥ 40 mm with invasion to other organs. Cancer-specific survival of Group S was worse than that of the PDAC group (median survival, 1.5 years vs. 4.1 years). All patients in Group A were alive at the end of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival of Group S was inferior to that of the PDAC group (median survival, 0.2 years vs. 1.8 years; Group A, not defined). Immunohistochemistry revealed the MIB-1 positivity rate in squamous cell carcinoma regions was 1.8 times higher than that in adenocarcinoma regions in the same specimens. In PASC patients, an increased proportion of squamous cell carcinoma components was associated with aggressive behavior and a worse prognosis. This was due to the high MIB-1 positivity rate of squamous cell carcinoma components. © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising strategy as an ""in situ vaccine"" to enhance activation of antitumor immune responses in solid tumors. However, the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lead to hypoxia and limited penetration of most drugs, aggravating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limiting the efficacy of synergistic sonodynamic immunotherapy. Therefore, it is essential to regulate ECM in order to alleviate tumor hypoxia and enhance the efficacy of sonodynamic immunotherapy for PDAC. The CPIM nanoplatform, consisting of a macrophage membrane-coated oxygen and drug delivery system (CM@PFOB-ICG-α-Mangostin), was synthesized using ultrasound and extrusion methods. The in vivo homologous targeting and hypoxia alleviation capabilities of CPIM were evaluated through near-infrared (NIR) imaging and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The tumor growth inhibition potential and ability to reprogram the tumor microenvironment by the CPIM nanoplatform were also investigated. Co-delivery of α-Mangostin inhibits CAFs and enhances stromal depletion, thereby facilitating better infiltration of macromolecules. Additionally, the nanoemulsion containing perfluorocarbon (PFC) can target tumor cells and accumulate within them through homologous targeting. The US irradiation results in the rapid release of oxygen, serving as a potential source of sonodynamic therapy for hypoxic tumors. Moreover, CPIM reshapes the immunosuppressive microenvironment increasing the population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and enhancing their anti-tumor immune response through the use of anti-PDL1 antibodies to block immune checkpoints. The present study offers a potential strategy for the co-delivery of oxygen and α-Mangostin, aiming to enhance the penetration of tumors to improve SDT. This approach effectively addresses the existing limitations of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in solid tumors, while simultaneously boosting the immune response through synergistic sonodynamic immunotherapy. © 2024.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common pancreatic cancer, is a deadly cancer, often diagnosed late and resistant to current therapies. PDAC patients are frequently affected by cachexia characterized by muscle mass and strength loss (sarcopenia) contributing to patient frailty and poor therapeutic response. This study assesses the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial remodeling in the cachectic skeletal muscle, through an integrative exploration combining functional, morphological, and omics-based evaluation of gastrocnemius muscle from KIC genetically engineered mice developing autochthonous pancreatic tumor and cachexia. Cachectic PDAC KIC mice exhibit severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fiber's size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophied muscles show reduced respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways. Beyond the metabolic pathways known to be altered in sarcopenic muscle (carbohydrates, proteins, and redox), lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms are also affected. Although the number of mitochondria per cell is not altered, mitochondrial mass shows a twofold decrease and the mitochondrial DNA threefold, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis. In conclusion, this work provides a framework to guide toward the most relevant targets in the clinic to limit PDAC-induced cachexia. © 2024, Gicquel et al."
"Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is a highly complex, invasive, and costly surgical procedure. Limited evidence on the PD volume-cost relationship in countries with a low population density exists. This study aimed to investigate this issue in Australia. This retrospective cohort study included pancreatic cancer patients who had a PD at any public hospital in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2019. The primary outcome was the total hospital cost during PD admission (not including patient financial burden). Study hospitals were grouped into low-volume hospitals (LVHs; <10 PDs per annum) or high-volume hospitals (HVHs). Multivariable modelling was applied to examine the association between volume and cost. Of 443 PDs, the median total hospital cost per patient at HVHs was AU$55398; significantly lower than that at LVHs (AU$62859; P = 0.001). After adjusting for available patient and clinical factors, the total cost per patient at LVHs was 22% higher than that of HVHs (adjusted estimate: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08-1.37; P = 0.002). Similar patterns were found in three main cost components: 24% higher employee cost at LVHs than at HVHs (1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41; P < 0.001), 15% higher operating cost (1.15, 95% CI: 1.00-1.31; P = 0.047), and 31% higher other costs (1.31, 95% CI: 1.12-1.53; P < 0.001). Performance of PDs at HVHs was associated with substantially lower hospital costs. Our findings demonstrate the likely economic benefit of centralizing PDs in countries with a relatively low population density. Future studies should investigate related patient financial burdens. © 2024 The Author(s).

"V-domain Imuunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) seems a promising immune checkpoint target in cancer treatment; however, its prognostic significance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unknown. Herein, 29 fresh PDAC tissue samples were used to evaluate the mRNA expression level of VISTA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Besides, 40 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PDAC tissues were collected to evaluate VISTA protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR indicated that high expression of VISTA was significantly correlated with advanced stages of the cancer, based on the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stagingand tumor cell differentiation.  Immunohistochemistry results also showed significant correlation of the elevated cytoplasmic expression of VISTA with advanced TNM stages, older age of the patients and was a worsening indicator, regarding the disease-specific survival. In conclusion, we found that the expression levels of VISTA can be a potential prognostic biomarker in PDAC patients and its elevated levels are correlated with poor prognostic outcomes."
"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the deadliest and most aggressive human malignancies for which there is currently no effective treatment. Tyrosine kinase receptor RON is highly expressed in various cancer types, including colon, pancreatic and thyroid cancer. However, its underlying role in ATC is not fully understood. The present study investigated the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanism of RON in ATC. RON expression in thyroid cancer cells was detected by western blotting. Glycolysis was assessed by measuring the extracellular acidification rate, glucose uptake, lactate concentration, and expression levels of glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M1/2. In addition, ferroptosis was assessed by detecting the levels of total iron, lipid peroxide and reactive oxygen species, and the expression levels of ferroptosis‑related proteins. Furthermore, mitochondrial function were assessed by JC‑1 staining and detection kits, respectively. The results demonstrated that RON was highly expressed in thyroid cancer cell lines. Furthermore, RON interference inhibited glycolysis, promoted ferroptosis, elevated cell sensitivity to chemotherapy and affected mitochondrial function in thyroid cancer cells. Further experiments demonstrated that RON interference affected the ferroptosis levels in thyroid cancer cells by inhibiting the glycolysis process. Mechanistically, the present results indicated that RON may affect ferroptosis, glycolysis and chemotherapy sensitivity by regulating MAPK/cAMP‑response element binding protein (CREB) signaling in thyroid cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that RON affected ferroptosis, glycolysis and chemotherapy sensitivity in thyroid cancer cells by regulating MAPK/CREB signaling, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic target in thyroid cancer cells."
"Several tyrosine kinase receptors inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated antiproliferative effects in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We aimed to summarize and appraise the current evidence of the efficacy of TKIs in patients with different types of NETs. We performed a systematic review of clinical trials of TKIs in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic or lung NETs (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024507379). Population characteristics, efficacy, and safety results were summarized by type of NET. Twenty-eight studies were eligible, totaling 2284 patients. While sunitinib remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved TKI in patients with NETs (for patients with pancreatic well-differentiated NETs), recent placebo-controlled randomized trials have demonstrated improved response rates and progression-free survival for patients with progressive and pre-treated well-differentiated pancreatic (cabozantinib or surufatinib) or gastrointestinal (GI) NETs (pazopanib, cabozantinib, or surufatinib). There is limited evidence to support the use of a TKI in patients with lung or grade 3 NETs. The toxicity associated with TKIs follows a class effect, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing fatigue, hypertension, and hand-foot skin reactions. TKIs are effective therapies in patients with pancreatic or GI well-differentiated NETs and should be part of the therapeutical sequencing of these patients. © The Author(s), 2024."
"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are tumor cells that slough off the primary lesions and extravasate into the bloodstream. By forming CTC clusters and interacting with other circulating cells (platelets, NK cells, macrophage, etc.), CTCs are able to survive in the circulatory system of tumor patients and colonize to metastatic organs. In recent years, the potential of CTCs in diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and individualized therapy of various types of tumors has been gradually explored, while advances in biotechnology have made it possible to extract CTCs from patient blood samples. These biological features of CTCs provide us with new insights into cancer vulnerabilities. With the advent of new immunotherapies and personalized medicines, disrupting the heterotypical interaction between CTCs and circulatory cells as well as direct CTCs targeting hold great promise. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most malignant cancers, in part because of early metastasis, difficult diagnosis, and limited treatment options. Although there is significant potential for CTCs as a biomarker to impact PC from diagnosis to therapy, there still remain a number of challenges to the routine implementation of CTCs in the clinical management of PC. In this review, we summed up the progress made in understanding biological characteristics and exceptional technological advances of CTCs and provided insight into exploiting these developments to design future clinical tools for improving the diagnosis and treatment of PC. © The Author(s), 2024."
"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) plays a key role in tumor immune escape. Besides being a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of tryptophan catabolism, it also acts as a signal-transducing protein, whose partnering with tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate (SHPs) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory subunit p85 promotes the establishment of a sustained immunosuppressive phenotype. While IDO1 inhibitors typically interfere with its enzymatic activity, we aimed to discover a more effective modulator capable of blocking not only the enzymatic but also the signaling-mediated functions of IDO1. By virtual screening, we identified the compound VS-15, which selectively binds the heme-free form of IDO1, inhibits its enzymatic activity, and reduces the IDO1-mediated signaling pathway by negatively interfering with its partnership with SHPs and PI3K regulatory subunit p85 as well as with the IDO1 anchoring to the early endosomes in tumor cells. Moreover, VS-15 counteracts the TGF-β-mediated immunosuppressive phenotype in dendritic cells and reduces the level of inhibition of T cell proliferation by suppressive monocytes isolated from patients affected by pancreatic cancer. Herein, we describe the discovery and characterization of a small molecule with an unprecedented mechanism of action, capable of inhibiting both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic activities of IDO1 by binding to its apo-form. These results pave the way for the development of next-generation IDO1 inhibitors with a unique competitive advantage over the currently available modulators, thereby opening therapeutic opportunities in cancer immunotherapy. © 2024 The Authors.

"Thromboembolic events (TEEs) are frequent among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). We set out to estimate the incidence and establish predictive risk factors for TEE and estimate the impact of TEEs on the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic PAAD. This is a retrospective, single-center study. We included patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of PAAD with distant metastases treated at AC Camargo Cancer Center from 2016 to 2021. We used the competitive risk survival models to estimate the cumulative incidence of TEE. Risk factors for the development of TEEs were evaluated using the competitive risk and logistic regression models. The impact of TEEs on OS was assessed using both landmark and time-dependent covariate Cox survival analyses. The study population consists of 199 patients. The cumulative incidence of TEEs in 1, 6 and 24 months were 10.1%, 19.3% and 30.2%, respectively. Log 10 p p p TEEs occur in a large fraction of patients with metastatic PAAD. Statistical models with higher predictive performance are currently needed. For the time being, consideration for prophylactic anticoagulation should be done on an individual basis. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience."
"The aggressiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is primarily due to lack of effective early detection biomarkers. Circulating non-coding RNAs serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in multiple types of cancer. Comparison of their expression between diseased tissue and relevant body fluids such as saliva, urine, bile, pancreatic juice, blood etc. may reveal mechanistic involvement of common non-coding RNAs. piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs. The aim of the present study was to investigate plasma and tumour tissue piRNA changes in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) and explore the possible role in tumorigenesis and pancreatic inflammation. Sequencing of circulating plasma small RNAs from patients with PC and chronic pancreatitis (CP) was performed and differentially expressed piRNAs were compared with those in tissues. Subsequent search for target genes for those piRNAs was performed followed by pathway and cluster analysis. A total of 36 piRNAs were shown to be deregulated in pancreatic tumour tissue and alteration of 11 piRNAs was detected in plasma of patients with PC. piRNAs hsa-piR-23246, hsa-piR-32858 and hsa-piR-9137 may serve a key role in PC development as their expression was correlated in both plasma and tumour tissue. Key piRNA-target interactions interfering with key biological pathways were also characterized. A total of 19 deregulated piRNAs in plasma samples of patients with CP was identified; these targeted genes responsible for chronic inflammation. Therefore, the present study provides a comprehensive description of piRNA alteration in pancreatic malignancy and inflammation; these may be explored for biomarker potential in future.

"Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) is a pathological condition that causes various symptoms due to the continuous secretion of pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas upstream, which has been separated due to disconnection of the pancreatic duct (DPD) for various reasons.Acute necrotizing pancreatitis includes a certain probability of DPDS appearance, which makes it necessary to provide various treatments for DPDS. Furthermore, DPDS can impact long-term results, such as recurrence and impaired pancreatic function. Although the development of various modalities has contributed to diagnosis and treatment, especially less invasive endoscopic therapy, DPDS is often overlooked, and the diagnosis can be delayed due to the lack of consensus on its definition and classification. This review summarizes the current knowledge and challenges of DPDS and discusses the optimal strategy for its diagnosis and treatment, as well as future perspectives. Given the lack of established definition, diagnosis, and treatment of DPDS, we conducted a thorough review of the existing literature. it is emphasized that a standardized definition and classification of DPDS is essential for designing and conducting clinical studies to address current unmet needs in managing patients with DPDS."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a challenge in oncology due to its high lethality and resistance to immunotherapy. Recently, emerging research on the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway offers novel opportunities for immunotherapy. Although STING expression is retained in PDAC cells, the response of PDAC cells to STING agonists remains ineffective. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a downstream pathway of STING, is notably overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and related to tumor survival and immune escape. We observed that inhibiting STAT3 signaling post-STING activation effectively suppressed tumor growth through signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated apoptosis but led to a potential risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). To address this issue, we designed a tumor-penetrating liposome for the codelivery of STING agonist and STAT3 inhibitor. These nanoparticles regulated the STING/STAT3 signaling axis and effectively inhibited the proliferation and survival of tumor. Simultaneously, we found a significant increase in the activation of NK cells and CD8 +"
"The purpose of this study was to translate the Vicarious Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (VPTGI) into Chinese and to assess its reliability and validity in Nurses, Additionally, it explored the correlations between vicarious posttraumatic growth (VPTG), Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) and demographic variables. The Brislin translation model was used to translate the VPTGI into Chinese. Validity analysis involved exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and assessments of convergent validity, discriminant validity, and content validity. Reliability analysis included split-half reliability, internal consistency reliability, and test-retest reliability. Item analysis employed the Critical Ratio Decision Value (CR) method, item-total correlation method, and reliability change method. Single-factor analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between demographic variables and VPTG, while correlation analysis explored the association between STS and VPTG. The Chinese version VPTGI demonstrated robust content validity (I-CVI: 0.83-1, S-CVI: 0.97), supported by EFA (KMO: 0.933) and significant Bartlett's test (p < 0.001). Four factors explained 67.82% variance, CFA confirmed the model fit (χ2/df = 2.255, RMSEA = 0.079, IFI = 0.931, TLI = 0.914, CFI = 0.930, NFI = 0.882). The Chinese version VPTGI demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.951), with dimensions' Cronbach's α ranging from 0.806 to 0.912. Overall, nurses demonstrated a moderate to low level of VPTG and a severe level of STS. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between STS and VPTG. The Chinese version of VPTGI demonstrated satisfactory reliability, validity, and factor structure, making it a reliable tool to assess VPTG in Chinese nurses. These findings underscore the importance of promoting VPTG and addressing STS among healthcare professionals. Further research in this area is warranted to better understand and support the psychological well-being of nurses. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Immunotherapy has made significant strides in cancer treatment, particularly through immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which has shown notable clinical benefits across various tumor types. Despite the transformative impact of ICB treatment in cancer therapy, only a minority of patients exhibit a positive response to it. In patients with solid tumors, those who respond well to ICB treatment typically demonstrate an active immune profile referred to as the ""hot"" (immune-inflamed) phenotype. On the other hand, non-responsive patients may exhibit a distinct ""cold"" (immune-desert) phenotype, differing from the features of ""hot"" tumors. Additionally, there is a more nuanced ""excluded"" immune phenotype, positioned between the ""cold"" and ""hot"" categories, known as the immune ""excluded"" type. Effective differentiation between ""cold"" and ""hot"" tumors, and understanding tumor intrinsic factors, immune characteristics, TME, and external factors are critical for predicting tumor response and treatment results. It is widely accepted that ICB therapy exerts a more profound effect on ""hot"" tumors, with limited efficacy against ""cold"" or ""altered"" tumors, necessitating combinations with other therapeutic modalities to enhance immune cell infiltration into tumor tissue and convert ""cold"" or ""altered"" tumors into ""hot"" ones. Therefore, aligning with the traits of ""cold"" and ""hot"" tumors, this review systematically delineates the respective immune characteristics, influencing factors, and extensively discusses varied treatment approaches and drug targets based on ""cold"" and ""hot"" tumors to assess clinical efficacy. © 2024.

"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by an autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells and a chronic inflammatory state, which may influence the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through immune system dysregulation and enhanced tumor immune evasion. This study aims to elucidate the role of p65 in modulating the tumor microenvironment in CRC within the context of T1D and to determine how this modulation affects tumor growth, immune cell infiltration, and the expression of immune evasion molecules such as CEACAM5. NOD mice, which model T1D, were inoculated with MC38 colon carcinoma cells engineered to knock down p65. Tumor growth was monitored, and the tumor microenvironment was analyzed using flow cytometry to assess the infiltration of immune cells. The expression of Ki-67 and CEACAM5 in tumor cells was also evaluated. Additionally, in vitro assays were conducted to study the proliferation and activation of T cells co-cultured with tumor cells. Knockdown of p65 in tumor cells significantly inhibited tumor growth in NOD mice. This was accompanied by an increased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and no significant change in CD4+ or Foxp3 + T regulatory cells within the tumor microenvironment. There was a notable reduction in the expression of Ki-67 and CEACAM5, indicating decreased proliferation and potential immune evasion capabilities of the tumor cells. Our findings demonstrate that the NF-κB p65 subunit plays a crucial role in promoting tumor growth and modulating the immune microenvironment in CRC, particularly in the context of T1D. Knocking down p65 not only reduces tumor progression but also enhances the anti-tumor immune response by decreasing immune evasion mechanisms. These results suggest that targeting the NF-κB pathway may be a viable strategy to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases like T1D. Physical activity enhances the effect of immune checkpoint blockade by inhibiting the intratumoral HIF1-α/CEACAM5 axis. © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Ubiquitination is one of the important modification of proteins which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Ubiquitin specific protease 28 (USP28) belongs to the deubiquitinase family, which plays a cancer-promoting function in many types of cancers such as pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. So far, the molecular function and significance of USP 28 in cholangiocarcinoma remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the expression of USP28 using tissue microarray (TMA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and online databases. We investigated the effect of USP28 on the progression of CCA through in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. In addition, we explored downstream molecular pathways using Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), and mass spectrometry techniques. Here, we found that cholangiocarcinoma tissue had higher USP 28 expression than normal bile duct tissue, and that high USP 28 levels were significantly associated with a malignant phenotype and poorer prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma patients. Both in vitro and in vivo, USP28 could mediate the deubiquitination of PKM2, thereby activating the downstream Hif1-α signaling pathway, promoting glycolysis and energy supply, and finally promoting tumor progression. In summary, USP28 activated downstream Hif1-α by reducing the ubiquitination level of PKM2, furthermore, promoting the level of glycolysis in CCA cells for tumor progression. © 2024.

"This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of robotic gastrectomy (RG) and laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) in treating gastric cancer (GC). A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science identified 86 eligible studies, including 68,755 patients (20,894 in the RG group and 47,861 in the LG group). The analysis revealed that RG was associated with superior outcomes in several areas: more lymph nodes were harvested, intraoperative blood loss was reduced, postoperative hospital stays were shorter, and the time to first flatus and oral intake was shortened (all p < 0.001). Additionally, RG resulted in lower incidences of conversion to open surgery (OR = 0.62, p = 0.004), reoperation (OR = 0.68, p = 0.010), overall postoperative complications (OR = 0.82, p < 0.001), severe complications (OR = 0.65, p < 0.001), and pancreatic complications (OR = 0.60, p = 0.004). However, RG had longer operative times and higher costs (both p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between RG and LG in terms of resection margin distance, mortality, anastomotic leakage, or recurrence rates. RG is a safe and effective surgical option for patients of GC, but further improvements in operative duration and costs are needed. © 2024. Society of Surgical Oncology."
"Robotic surgery has demonstrated outcomes comparable or superior to open and laparoscopic surgeries for extended cholecystectomy. 1-8 9,10 A 62-year-old woman with a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer was referred for surgery. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans showed no evidence of metastasis (T2N0). Therefore, a robotic SP extended cholecystectomy was planned. Figure 1 shows a 30-mm SP port and a 1-mm assistant port inserted for the procedure. Due to the absence of an energy device for the liver wedge resection, Maryland bipolar forceps were used, mimicking the Kelly clamp crushing technique. A monopolar cautery hook was used for lymph node resection of stations 7, 8, 12, and 13 (Fig. 2). Fig. 1 Port placement for robotic extended cholecystectomy using the da Vinci Xi system Fig. 2 Demonstration of full lymph node dissection RESULTS: The total duration of the operation was 226 min, with an estimated blood loss of 200 ml. The CT scan on day 5 showed no abnormalities, and the patient was discharged routinely on day 7 (Fig. 3). The pathologic examination confirmed adenocarcinoma (T2a) with clear resection, and all six lymph nodes tested negative for malignancy. Fig. 3 The wound 2 weeks after surgery CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the adequacy of robotic surgeries and emphasizes the potential of the da Vinci SP system in hepatobiliary surgery.

"Risk factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) include tobacco/alcohol abuse, genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, and pancreatic cysts. Despite these well-established risk factors and the screening of high-risk individuals, some people still develop PDAC. This study aims to explore a potential risk factor for PDAC by investigating the association between fungal toxins (FT) and environmental toxins (ET) and the disease. We predicted that individuals with PDAC would have higher levels of these toxins compared to healthy controls. The rationale behind this hypothesis is that exposure to FT and ET might contribute to the development of PDAC by elevating cancer risk. A pilot retrospective cohort study was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center from 2022 to 2023. This study compared FT and ET levels, demographic data, and PDAC features between subjects with PDAC and healthy controls. Forty subjects were enrolled in the study, comprising 20 with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 20 healthy controls. Baseline demographics were similar between the two groups. Among the PDAC subjects, the most common tumor location was the head of the pancreas (55%); 30% had locally advanced disease, 45% were borderline resectable, and 10% had metastatic disease. Compared to the controls, subjects with PDAC had significantly higher levels of fungal toxins (FTs) including ochratoxin, gliotoxin, and citrinin (p < 0.05). Additionally, PDAC patients had significantly elevated levels of environmental toxins (ETs) such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), xylene, styrene, acrylonitrile, perchlorate, diphenyl phosphate, bromopropane, organophosphates, acrolein, tiglylglycine, and diethylphosphate (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrates that subjects with PDAC, without other risk factors, have higher FT and ET levels than controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether ET and FT exposure can be clinically utilized as a risk factor for PDAC development. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"CD200, a negative regulator of T cells as well as a marker for cancer stem cells, represents a significant prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in certain cancers. However, its clinical significance remains unknown in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CD200 was assessed in 220 resected PDAC patients who underwent surgery with or without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). We examined the clinicopathological outcomes associated with CD200 and further assessed its clinical implications regarding immunological and cancer stem cell properties. NACRT was associated with higher CD200 expression (66.4 % vs. 32.2 %, P < 0.001) compared to upfront surgery. CD200 was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor in NACRT (hazard ratio 1.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.12-3.23, P = 0.016), but not in upfront surgery patients. Post-recurrence survival was significantly worse in CD200+ patients compared to CD200- patients in the NACRT group, but there was no significant difference observed in the upfront surgery group. CD200 expression was correlated with significantly lower levels of CD4 + + + Our data underscore novel roles for CD200 in immune evasion as well as therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. CD200 may represent a novel poor prognostic predictive factor and potential therapeutic target for PDAC with NACRT. Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier B.V."
"To investigate the practices of clinicians prescribing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for unresectable pancreatic cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia. A mixed media advertising campaign was used to recruit appropriate clinicians to complete a questionnaire that collected demographic data, information regarding prescribed medication, and awareness of PERT guidelines. The study recruited 161 clinicians, with 93 and 68 respondents from Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia respectively. Most respondents from both countries were experienced gastrointestinal surgeons and dietitians. Aotearoa New Zealand clinicians and dietitians used faecal elastase more frequently to diagnose PEI than other groups. Clinicians had a tendency to under-prescribe PERT, and to advise incorrectly on the timing of the medication. The majority of clinicians from Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia were not aware of any best practice clinical guidelines for PERT (70 % and 77 %, respectively). This study suggests clinicians are over-reliant on faecal elastase to diagnose PEI and are uncertain about the correct dose and timing of PERT for optimal patient benefit in those with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Most clinicians were not aware of best practice guidelines. Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Surgical resection is the standard recommended treatment in localized pancreatic cancer. The benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still debated. The aim of this population-based study was to describe the pancreatic cancer surgical management. An observational real-world study from the French Network of Cancer Registries sampled 638 pancreatic adenocarcinomas diagnosed in 2019. Characteristics of patients, tumours and recommended and administered treatments were collected. Operability of the patients and resectability of the tumours were described. A multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the probability of having surgical resection. Among the 263 (41 %) patients with M0 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 202 patients (77 %) were considered operable and 157 (60 %) also had a tumour considered resectable.

"Enteroviruses, which infect via the gut, have been implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) development. Prolonged faecal shedding of enterovirus has been associated with islet autoimmunity. Additionally, enteroviral proteins and viral RNA have been detected in the pancreatic islets of individuals with recent-onset T1D, implicating their possible role in beta cell destruction. Despite this, no approved antiviral drugs currently exist that specifically target enterovirus infections for utilisation in disease interventions. Drug repurposing allows for the discovery of new clinical uses for existing drugs and can expedite drug discovery. Previously, the cancer drug Vemurafenib demonstrated unprecedented antiviral activity against several enteroviruses. In the present study, we assessed the efficacy of Vemurafenib and an analogue thereof in preventing infection or reducing the replication of enteroviruses associated with T1D. We tested Vemurafenib in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and insulin-producing beta cells. Additionally, we established a protocol for infecting human stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and used Vemurafenib and its analogue in this model. Our studies revealed that Vemurafenib exhibited strong antiviral properties in IECs and a beta cell line. The antiviral effect was also seen with the Vemurafenib analogue. SC-islets expressed the viral receptors CAR and DAF, with their highest expression in insulin- and glucagon-positive cells, respectively. SC-islets were successfully infected by CVBs and the antiviral activity of Vemurafenib and its analogue was confirmed in most SC-islet batches. In summary, our observations suggest that Vemurafenib and its analogue warrant further exploration as potential antiviral agents for the treatment of enterovirus-induced diseases, including T1D.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC), ranked as the globe's third leading malignancy. Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, the mortality rate remains distressingly high for those afflicted with advanced stages of the disease. Ferroptosis is a programmed form of cell death. The ways of ferroptosis mainly include promoting the accumulation of cellular ROS and increasing the level of cellular Labile iron pool (LIP). Immunosenescence is characterized by a gradual deterioration of the immune system's ability to respond to pathogens and maintain surveillance against cancer cells. In CRC, this decline is exacerbated by the tumor microenvironment, which can suppress the immune response and promote tumor progression. This paper reviews the relationship between iron prolapse and immune senescence in colorectal cancer, focusing on the following aspects: firstly, the different pathways that induce iron prolapse in colorectal cancer; secondly, immune-immune senescence in colorectal cancer; and lastly, the interactions between immune senescence and iron prolapse in colorectal cancer, e.g., immune-immune senescent cells often exhibit increased oxidative stress, leading to the accumulation of ROS, and consequently to lipid peroxidation and induction of iron-induced cell death. At the same time, ferroptosis induces immune cell senescence as well as alterations in the immune microenvironment by promoting the death of damaged or diseased cells and leading to the inflammation usually associated with it. In conclusion, by exploring the potential targets of ferroptosis and immune senescence in colorectal cancer therapy, we hope to provide a reference for future research. Copyright © 2024.

"L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a membrane transporter responsible for carrying large, neutral L-configured amino acids as well as appropriate (pro)drugs into a cell. It has shown a great potential to improve drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier and to increase cell uptake into several brain and cancer cell types. However, besides the brain, the LAT1-utilizing compounds are also delivered more efficiently into the pancreas in vivo. In this study, we quantified the expression of LAT1 along several other membrane transporters in mouse pancreatic β-cell line (MIN6). Furthermore, we studied the function of LAT1 in MIN6 cells, and its ability to deliver non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-derived prodrugs there. The results showed that LAT1 was highly abundant in MIN6 cells, with an even expression on cell pseudoislets. The L-leucine uptake as a probe substrate was efficient, with comparable affinity and capacity to previously studied mouse immortalized microglia (BV2). The NSAID-derived prodrugs utilized LAT1 for their delivery and were uptaken into MIN6 cells 2-300 times more efficiently when compared to their parent drugs. A similar increase in pancreatic delivery was observed also in vivo, where the pancreatic exposure was 2-10 times higher with selected prodrugs, indicating an excellent correlation between in vitro uptake and in vivo pancreatic delivery. Finally, the LAT1-utilizing prodrugs were able to reverse the effects of cytokines on insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, showing that improved delivery via LAT1 can enhance drug effects in the mouse pancreatic β-cell line.

"Pancreatic cancer, characterized by a dismal prognosis and limited treatment options, persists as a formidable challenge in oncology. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody-drug conjugates have achieved great success in solid tumors such as breast cancer and uroepithelial carcinoma. However, their efficacy against pancreatic cancer was insufficient in clinical trials, necessitating an imperative exploration of underlying mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we indicated that αTROP2-MMAE, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting TROP2, induced apoptosis through the caspase-9/PARP pathway and exerted potent antitumor effects against TROP2-positive pancreatic cancer. Simultaneously, RNA sequencing suggested significant changes in autophagy after αTROP2-MMAE treatment. The formation of autophagosomes and activation of autophagic flux were markedly induced through mechanisms associated with suppressing the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. The addition of pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy enhanced the cytotoxicity and apoptosis caused by αTROP2-MMAE, revealing the cytoprotective role of autophagy in TROP2-positive pancreatic cancer. In the subcutaneous xenograft model using BxPC3 cells, the combined administration of αTROP2-MMAE and an autophagy inhibitor elevated the tumor inhibition rate of αTROP2-MMAE from 71.6 % to 99.0 %, resulting in the eradication of tumors in half of the mice. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time the cytoprotective role of autophagy in TROP2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate therapy for pancreatic cancer, providing new perspectives for mechanistic exploration and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

"The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interaction 1 (Pin1) catalyzes the transition of the proline ring from the cis to trans conformation, resulting in conformational and functional changes in proteins that are regulated by proline-guided serine/threonine phosphorylation. In recent years, Pin1 has emerged as a novel molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of various malignant tumors. Notably, it has been found that Pin1 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer. This article focuses on the mechanisms by which Pin1 orchestrates multiple oncogenic functions in the development of pancreatic cancer. By exploring the intricate interactions between Pin1 and the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, we provide an overview of Pin1's role in modifying glycolytic metabolism, redox balance, and the hypoxic microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we summarize the potential anticancer effects of Pin1 inhibitors, aiming to elucidate Pin1's promise as a potential anticancer agent, particularly in the context of pancreatic cancer.

"The incidence of GI cancers is increasing in sub-Saharan African countries. We described the oncological care pathway and assessed presentation, diagnosis, and treatment intervals and delays among patients with GI cancer who presented to the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. We analyzed data from 545 patients with GI cancer in the African Research Group for Oncology (ARGO) database. We defined presentation interval as the interval between symptom onset and presentation to tertiary hospital, diagnostic interval as between presentation and diagnosis, and treatment interval as between diagnosis and initiation of treatment. We considered >3 months, >1 month, and >1 month to be presentation, diagnosis, and treatment delays, respectively. We compared lengths of intervals using Mann-Whitney  U The most frequent cancer types were pancreatic (32%) and colorectal (28%). Most patients presented at stages III (38%) and IV (30%). The median presentation interval was 84 days (IQR, 56-191), and 49% presented after 3 months or longer. The median diagnosis and treatment intervals were 0 (IQR, 0-8) and 7 (IQR, 0-23) days, respectively. There was no relationship between age, sex, education, or distance to tertiary hospital and presentation delay, but patients with stage III to IV versus I to II had higher odds of presentation delay (odds ratio [OR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.13 to 2.50]). Among patients with pancreatic cancer, older patients were less likely to have a diagnosis delay (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.98]). About half of patients with GI cancer in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, did not present to tertiary hospitals until more than 90 days after noticing symptoms. Efforts are warranted to improve public knowledge of GI cancer symptoms and to strengthen health systems for prompt diagnosis and referral to specialty care."
"This study aims to clarify the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in resectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and develop a predictive risk score for treatment selection. Patients with resected CCA undergoing curative surgery, with or without AC, were identified from three centers in Thailand. Patients with R2 resection and 30 days postoperative death were excluded. Using the largest center as the discovery cohort, we generated propensity score matching (PSM). A predictive model for overall survival (OS) was identified, and a predictive risk score was developed from the PSM discovery cohort, classifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. The proposed risk score was validated in the other two centers. In the discovery cohort, 493 patients were identified. After PSM, 328 patients were categorized into surgery (n = 164) and surgery + AC (n = 164) groups. The baseline characteristics in the PSM discovery cohort were well-balanced. In the validation cohort (n = 83), patients with positive lymph node 1 received AC more frequently than those under observation (47%  v P v P v P Patients with resected CCA with a high-risk MINT pathologic risk score were likely to benefit from AC, whereas those with a low-risk score were not.

"Despite the presence of various guidelines, diagnosing malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) continues to pose challenges. Furthermore, although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) offers high-resolution images, it has not yet recognized as the primary tool for malignancy diagnosis. The study objective was to develop a simplified and user-friendly scoring system to improve the diagnostic accuracy of malignant IPMNs. Additionally, the utility of EUS and its effect on diagnostic accuracy were assessed. We retrospectively collected the clinical data on 160 cases of resected IPMN at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from January 2008 to December 2022. We examined clinical features, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and EUS results if available. We then calculated the odds ratio of malignancy for these factors and developed an IPMN malignancy prediction (IMAP) scoring system. There were 89 (55.6%) cases of benign IPMNs and 71 (44.4%) of malignant IPMNs. Eight clinical and imaging findings, including age, diabetes mellitus status, jaundice, CA19-9 level, enhancing mural nodules ≥5mm, thickened wall, and main duct dilatation, were significantly associated with malignancy. The IMAP score was calculated by assigning 0 to 2 points to these factors based on the odds ratio. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the IMAP score was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.85] based on CT/MRI alone and improved to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74-0.87) when EUS was added. When the total exceeds 5 points, the positive predictive value becomes 100% (95% CI: 95.9-100). In conclusion, the IMAP scoring system has demonstrated promise as a clinically useful tool, offering both simplicity and sufficient accuracy. It holds potential as an important decision criterion for determining the treatment approach for IPMN. Additionally, EUS contributes to enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of the IMAP scoring system, thereby enabling more precise decision-making. Copyright: © 2024 Kobayashi et al.

"Data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on pancreatic cancer incidence are limited and inconsistent. Here we evaluate the association of GLP-1RAs, alone and in combinations, with incident pancreatic cancer risk in a real-world population, stratified by obesity and smoking status. This retrospective cohort included patients with T2DM who were prescribed GLP-1RAs or other non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications between January 2013 and March 2019 and had no prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The incident (first-time) diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during a 5-year follow-up was compared between propensity-score matched cohorts of patients prescribed GLP-1RAs vs other non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients stratified by the status of obesity and tobacco use disorder. We also compared GLP-1RA combination therapies with monotherapies. Time-to-first-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated. The study population comprised 1,636,056 eligible patients including 167,091 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 1,468,965 prescribed other anti-diabetes medications. GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly decreased risk for pancreatic cancer incidence compared with each of six non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications with HR ranging from 0.42 to 0.82. The reduction was greater in patients with obesity and tobacco use disorder than in those without. GLP-1RA combination therapies were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk compared with monotherapies. GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence in patients with T2DM. Further studies and trials are needed to explore mechanisms and confirm causal effects. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

"Associations of body mass index (BMI) with survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) have substantial variability in literature, potentially due to heterogeneous patient populations and retrospective analyses. Additionally, BMI may inadequately describe body composition (ie, morphomics; including subcutaneous and visceral fats, muscle, and fascia), which might have independent biological roles and associations with survival. To study the associations of BMI and morphomics with survival and metabolomics in metastatic PDA. This cohort study prospectively collected patient data, imaging, and serum on the phase 3 trial (Avenger500), which investigated the efficacy and safety of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) versus modified FOLFIRINOX plus devimistat. The randomized trial accrued 528 patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic PDA from Europe, Israel, Korea, and the US between 2018 and 2020. In the present study, per-protocol patients with L1 to L4, T10 to T12 vertebral levels were evaluated. Data analysis occurred from January 2023 to April 2024. Patient data were collected by clinical staff. Morphomics were analyzed from baseline imaging. Metabolites were extracted from baseline serum. A multifaceted statistical approach evaluated associations of BMI and morphomics with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Associations of morphomics with metabolites were also studied. Of the 528 initial patients, 476 (median [IQR] age, 63 [56-68] years; 280 male [58.8%]; median [IQR] BMI, 25.0 [22.1-25.9]) were evaluable for the present study. BMI (obese [≥30] compared with normal [18.5-24.9]) was not associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67-1.22; P for trend = .33). More subcutaneous fat was associated with longer OS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.94; P for trend = .02). Higher visceral fat density was associated with shorter PFS (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.23-2.48; P for trend = .002) and OS (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12-2.00; P for trend = .008). A higher muscle-to-fascia ratio was associated with longer PFS (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84; P for trend = .005) and OS (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.75; P for trend = 1.7 × 10-4). Subcutaneous fat was positively associated with long-chain fatty acid metabolism including pristanic acid, decanoylcarnitine, decenoylcarnitine, and octanoylcarnitine. Muscle-to-fascia was positively associated with metabolites including acetylcarnosine (β = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.47; P = 1.27 × 10-6). In cohort study of patients with metastatic PDA, BMI was not associated with survival. Higher visceral fat density, subcutaneous fat area, and muscle-to-fascia ratio were associated with survival independent of BMI. The latter 2 were associated with higher levels of animal product metabolism. These findings could represent novel focuses for prognostication and intervention to improve survival of patients with PDA."
"Combined pancreatic and vascular resections are increasingly performed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We evaluated the outcomes after pancreatectomy with non-vascular resection (NVR), venous resection (VR), and arterial resection (AR). Retrospective review (2011-2023) of 715 PDAC patients treated with curative-intent surgery. Associations among clinicopathological data, perioperative therapy, time to recurrence (TTR), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Initial staging revealed 533 resectable, 98 borderline, and 84 locally advanced PDAC cases. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was the most common procedure (n=467). NVR was performed in 351 (58.2%) patients, VR in 181 (30.0%), and AR in 70 (11.8%). The median TTR and OS did not significantly differ according to the initial staging or type of pancreas resection. Median TTR and OS were significantly shorter for VR (14.5 and 22.7 mo) compared to NVR (18.6 and 30.5 mo, P<0.001) and AR (20.6 and 30.9 mo, P=0.004 and P=0.017). Chemotherapy or chemoradiation significantly prolonged TTR (20.1 vs. 10.2 mo, P<0.001 and 25.3 vs. 16.4 mo, P<0.001) and OS (31.5 vs. 17.2 mo, P<0.001 and 35.5 vs. 27.5 mo, P=0.030). AR was associated with higher 90-day mortality rates. In the multivariable analysis, vascular resection was not associated with OS. Perioperative therapy, pathological N0 status, and absence of perineural invasion were the key predictors of longer TTR and OS. Pancreatectomy with AR was not associated with worse oncological outcomes when controlling for perioperative therapy. However, AR was associated with higher 90-day mortality rates. Patient selection is crucial when performing AR in patients with PDAC. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a revolutionary immunotherapeutic strategy that has shown efficacy in hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors, particularly gastrointestinal cancers, faces significant challenges. These include the selection of target antigens, the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, and safety and toxicity concerns. This review provides a current overview of CAR-T therapy in various gastrointestinal cancers, such as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers. It discusses the limitations and future directions of CAR-T therapy in this context. This review highlights innovative strategies, including novel target antigens, multispecific CAR-T cells, armored CAR-T cells, and the development of universal CAR-T cells.

"KRAS mutations occur in ~40-50% of mCRC and are associated with aggressive disease that is refractory to anti-EGFR therapies. Pancreatic cancer harbors ~90% KRAS driver gene mutation frequency. Small molecules targeting KRAS G12C gained FDA approval for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. ONC212, a fluorinated imipridone with nM anti-cancer activity has preclinical efficacy against pancreatic cancer and other malignancies. MRTX1133, identified as a noncovalent selective KRAS G12D inhibitor that suppresses G12D signaling by binding to the switch II pocket thereby inhibiting protein-protein interactions. We investigated cell viability, drug synergies, pERK suppression and cytokine, chemokine or growth factor alterations following treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or ONC212 plus MRTX1133 in 6 human CRC and 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. IC50 sensitivities ranged from 7 to 12 µM for 5-FU, 0.2-0.8 µM for ONC212, and > 100 nM to > 5,000 nM for MRTX1133 (G12D N = 4: LS513 > 100, HPAF-II > 1,000, SNUC2B > 5,000, PANC-1 > 5,000). For non-G12D, the range of IC50 for MRTX1133 was > 1,000 to > 5,000 nM for CRC lines with G12V, G13D, or WT KRAS (N = 7). Synergies between MRTX1133 plus 5-FU or ONC212 were observed regardless of KRAS G12D mutation with combination indices of < 0.5 indicating strong synergy. Observed synergies were greater with MRTX1133 plus ONC212 compared to MRTX1133 plus 5-FU. pERK was suppressed with mutant but not wild-type KRAS at nM MRTX1133 doses. Immunostimulatory profiles included reduction in IL8/CXCL8, MICA, Angiopoietin 2, VEGF and TNF-alpha and increase in IL-18/IL-1F4 with MRTX treatments and combinations. Our studies reveal preclinical activity of MRTX1133 alone or synergies when combined with 5-FU or ONC212 against mCRC and pancreatic cancer cells regardless of KRAS G12D mutation. The results suggest that KRAS G12V and KRAS G13D should be further considered in clinical trials including combination therapies involving MRTX1133 and 5-FU or ONC212. AJCR Copyright © 2024."
"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and metastatic tumor that lacks effective early detection and treatment methods. There is an urgent need to further understand its underlying molecular mechanisms and identify new biomarkers for early detection. Zinc, a critical trace element and catalytic cofactor, is tightly regulated within cells. ZIP4, a zinc transporter protein significantly overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer, appears to play a pivotal role in tumor development by modulating intracellular zinc concentration. This review highlights the role of ZIP4 in tumorigenesis, including its impact on pancreatic cancer growth, proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. ZIP4 exerts its effects by regulating zinc dependent transcriptional factors like CREB, STAT3, and ZEB1, resulting in upregulation of Cyclin D1, TP53INP1, ITGA3, CD44, ENT1 proteins, and miR-373. Moreover, ZIP4 mediates the miR373-PHLPP2-AKT signaling axis, which increases TGF-β expression. Coupled with CREB-activated macrophage catabolism-related genes SDC1 and DNM2, ZIP4 promotes cancer cachexia and supports amino acids to tumor cells under metabolic stress. Furthermore, ZIP4 facilitates bone resorption by osteoclasts via the RANKL-activated NF-κB pathway. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may unveil potential targets for early diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and dietary recommendations for pancreatic cancer. These findings hold clinical significance not only for pancreatic cancer but also for other malignancies exhibiting heightened ZIP4 expression. AJCR Copyright © 2024."

"Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can be exploited to treat non-immunoreactive tumors that do not respond to current standard and innovative therapies. Not all chemotherapeutics trigger ICD, among those that do exert this effect, there are anthracyclines, irinotecan, some platinum derivatives and oncolytic peptides. We studied two new branched oncolytic peptides, BOP7 and BOP9 that proved to elicit the release of damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPS, mediators of ICD, in pancreatic cancer cells. The two BOPs selectively bound and killed tumor cells, particularly PANC-1 and Mia PaCa-2, but not cells of non-tumor origin such as RAW 264.7, CHO-K1 and pgsA-745. The cancer selectivity of the two BOPs may be attributed to their repeated cationic sequences, which enable multivalent binding to heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSPGs), bearing multiple anionic sulfation patterns on cancer cells.

"The outcome of clinical trials evaluating drugs targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) has been poor, with primary concerns related to lack of efficacy. HER3 is considered a difficult target since its overexpression on tumors is relatively low and there is normal expression in many different organs. However, a significant number of patients across different cancer indications have overexpression of HER3 and the development of novel modalities targeting HER3 is therefore warranted.

"Several studies have evaluated the impact of sarcopenic obesity (SO) on postoperative complications, including postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). Previous studies have shown that SO increases POPF, but it remains unclear whether SO increases postoperative complications. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between SO and immediate postoperative complications. From January 2005 to December 2019, the medical records of patients who underwent PD for periampullary cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) were calculated from preoperative computed tomography images. Patients with high VFA were classified as obese, while those with low SMI were classified as sarcopenic. Patients were divided into 4 groups: normal group, sarcopenia only group, obesity only group, and SO group. Postoperative outcomes were compared between groups, and factors affecting postoperative complications were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Normal group (n = 176), sarcopenia only group (n = 130), obesity only group (n = 207), and SO group (n = 117) were analyzed retrospectively. SO group had significantly more frequent major complications compared to the normal group (P = 0.006), as well as a significantly more frequent clinically relevant POPF compared to the other groups (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, SO was an independent risk factor for major complications (P = 0.008) and clinically relevant POPF (P = 0.003). SO is a factor associated with poor immediate postoperative outcomes after PD for periampullary cancer. Copyright © 2024, the Korean Surgical Society."
"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and immunosuppressive features that limit the efficacy of existing treatments. This paper reviews the potential of combining ultrasound with macrophage exhaustion in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Macrophages, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are crucial in pancreatic cancer progression and immune escape. Prolonged exposure to the immunosuppressive TME leads to macrophage exhaustion, reducing their anti-tumor ability and instead promoting tumor growth. The CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway is key in macrophage recruitment and functional regulation, making it an effective target for combating macrophage exhaustion. Ultrasound technology not only plays a significant role in diagnosis and staging but also enhances therapeutic efficacy by guiding radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous alcohol injection (PEI) in combination with immunomodulators. Additionally, ultrasound imaging can monitor the number and functional status of TAMs in real-time, providing a basis for optimizing treatment strategies. Future studies should further investigate the combined use of ultrasound and immunomodulators to refine treatment regimens, address challenges such as individual variability and long-term effects, and offer new hope for pancreatic cancer patients.

"Pancreatic cancer is usually detected through contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. However, pancreatic cancer is occasionally overlooked because of its small size or is misdiagnosed as other conditions due to atypical imaging features that present diagnostic challenges. Considering the rapid growth and poor prognosis associated with pancreatic cancer, the ability to accurately detect and differentiate pancreatic lesions is crucial for appropriate surgical intervention. Reviewing diverse challenging cases of pancreatic cancer at an early stage and other mimicking lesions may help us accurately interpret the imaging features of pancreatic cancer on CT and MRI scans. Therefore, we aimed to illustrate various imaging features of pancreatic cancer and its mimicking lesions and provide valuable insights for differential diagnosis.

"Homologous recombination (HR) is an important mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and preserving genome integrity. Pathogenic mutations in the HR proteins BRCA2 and the RAD51 paralogs predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The RAD51 paralogs: RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3 form two complexes RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (BCDX2) and RAD51C-XRCC3 (CX3). Similar to BRCA2, loss of RAD51 paralog functions in mammalian cells lead to chromosomal abnormalities, growth defects, disrupted RAD51 foci formation, and PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Despite significant effort over the past three decades, the specific molecular functions of the human RAD51 paralogs have remained elusive due to technical challenges such as low protein expression in human cell lines and instability of the purified proteins. Recent studies have determined the molecular structures of the BCDX2 and CX3 complexes dramatically enhancing our understanding of these challenging proteins. Using multiple approaches, we demonstrate that the RAD51 paralogs interact with BRCA2 at two distinct interaction hubs located in the BRC repeats and the DNA binding domain. We confirm, using a yeast 3-hybrid approach, that human RAD51 paralogs interact directly with BRC repeats one and two (BRC1-2) of BRCA2. Because of the dynamic nature of the RAD51B C-terminal domain (CTD), identified in the recently solved cryo-EM structures, we focused on elucidating the interaction with RAD51B. We determined that BRCA2 interacts with the CTD of RAD51B and not the N-terminal domain (NTD) that is involved in stacking interactions with RAD51C and RAD51D. Furthermore, the interaction with RAD51B is dependent upon an FxxA motif located on a surface exposed region of the CTD. Our study has identified novel interactions between the RAD51 paralogs and BRCA2 and further demonstrated that a previously unrecognized FxxA motif located within a mobile element of RAD51B is critical for the interaction."
"Organs in the abdominal cavity are covered by a peritoneal membrane, which is comprised of a monolayer of mesothelial cells (MC). Diseases involving the peritoneal membrane include peritonitis, primary cancer (mesothelioma), and metastatic cancers (ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal). These diseases have gender- and/or age-related pathologies; however, the impact of gender and age on the peritoneal MC is not well evaluated. To address this, we identified and characterized gender- and age-related differences in the proteomes of murine primary peritoneal MC. Primary peritoneal MC were isolated from young female (FY) or male (MY) mice (3-6 months) and aged female (FA) or male (MA) mice (20-23 months), lysed, trypsin digested using S-Traps, then subjected to bottom-up proteomics using an LC-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. In each cohort, we identified >1000 protein groups. Proteins were categorized using Gene Ontology and pairwise comparisons between gender and age cohorts were conducted. This study establishes baseline information for studies on peritoneal MC in health and disease at two physiologic age/gender points. Segregation of the data by gender and age could reveal novel factors to specific disease states involving the peritoneum. [This  in vitro Many diseases initiate from or involve peritoneal mesothelial cells including peritonitis, primary cancer (mesothelioma) and metastatic cancers. Progression of these diseases is influenced by many host factors including gender and age; however, the influence of these factors on the peritoneal mesothelial cell proteome has not been evaluated. This study provides novel information and identifies proteins exclusive to both male and female young and aged cohorts. Given the importance of the peritoneal mesothelial cell in abdominal homeostasis, and the impact of gender and age on disease progression, these data will be key for future studies examining mesothelium in both health and disease."
"Immunotherapy is an emerging strategy in cancer therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system to inhibit pro-tumor pathways and increase a tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapy. Several clinically approved immunotherapy treatments, such as monoclonal antibody treatments, have been successful in solid tumors such as breast, colorectal, and pancreatic. However, an outstanding challenge of these strategies is tumor cell resistance. One target of interest for immune cell modulation is targeting macrophages that enter the tumor microenvironment. More specifically, an immune checkpoint of interest is CD47. CD47 is a transmembrane protein that inhibits phagocytic activity by acting as a ""don't eat me"" signal. In both mice and humans, healthy cells can express CD47, while solid malignancies like colorectal and breast cancer express it most strongly. Analysis of literature data on the physiological and functional roles of tissue-resident macrophages, along with the structure and mechanisms of action of the CD47 pathway was explored. We also explored how CD47 can influence different aspects of the tumor microenvironment (i.e. cellular metabolism and hypoxia) in addition to current clinical strategies and challenges associated with targeting CD47. Overall, it was discovered that CD47 is overexpressed in a variety of cancer types in addition to normal tissue, making it a promising treatment regimen to enhance the capability of macrophages to phagocytose tumor cells. However, treatment efficacy is varied in pre-clinical and clinical models due to various challenges such as off-target effects. This review emphasizes the diverse functionality of macrophages in normal and cancerous tissue, while also emphasizing the importance of macrophage targeting and their clinical significance."
"The discovery of embryonic stem cell (ESC) mediating tumoricidal activity revealed the intimate relationship between ESCs and tumor cells, but the functional role of ESCs in tumor progression is poorly understood. To further investigate tumor cell and ESC interactions, we co-cultured mouse ESCs with mouse pancreatic cancer Pan02 cells or mouse melanoma B16-F10 cells in Transwell, and found that tumor cell invasion was significantly inhibited by ESCs. Application of ESCs to tumor-bearing mice resulted in significant inhibition of tumor metastasis in vivo. RNA-Seq analyses of tumor cell and ESC co-cultures identified TP53 and related signalling as major pathways involved in ESC-mediated inhibition of tumor cell invasion and metastasis, which indicated the potential clinical application of ESCs to treat cancer. © 2024.
