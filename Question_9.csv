Abstract
"To investigate the practices of clinicians prescribing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for unresectable pancreatic cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia. A mixed media advertising campaign was used to recruit appropriate clinicians to complete a questionnaire that collected demographic data, information regarding prescribed medication, and awareness of PERT guidelines. The study recruited 161 clinicians, with 93 and 68 respondents from Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia respectively. Most respondents from both countries were experienced gastrointestinal surgeons and dietitians. Aotearoa New Zealand clinicians and dietitians used faecal elastase more frequently to diagnose PEI than other groups. Clinicians had a tendency to under-prescribe PERT, and to advise incorrectly on the timing of the medication. The majority of clinicians from Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia were not aware of any best practice clinical guidelines for PERT (70 % and 77 %, respectively). This study suggests clinicians are over-reliant on faecal elastase to diagnose PEI and are uncertain about the correct dose and timing of PERT for optimal patient benefit in those with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Most clinicians were not aware of best practice guidelines. Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to be the most common complication after distal pancreatectomy (DP). Recent advancements in surgical techniques have established minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) as the standard treatment for various conditions, including pancreatic cancer. However, MIDP has not demonstrated a clear advantage over open DP in terms of POPF rates, indicating the need for additional strategies to prevent POPF in MIDP. This trial (WRAP study) aims to evaluate the efficacy of wrapping the pancreatic stump with polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue in preventing clinically relevant (CR-) POPF following MIDP. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial will include patients scheduled for laparoscopic or robotic DP for tumors in the pancreatic body and/or tail. Eligible participants will be centrally randomized into either the control group (Group A) or the intervention group (Group B), where the pancreatic stump will be reinforced by PGA mesh and fibrin glue. In both groups, pancreatic transection will be performed using a bioabsorbable reinforcement-attached stapler. A total of 172 patients will be enrolled across 14 high-volume centers in Japan. The primary endpoint is the incidence of CR-POPF (International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery grade B/C). The WRAP study will determine whether the reinforcement of the pancreatic stump with PGA mesh and fibrin glue, a technique whose utility has been previously debated, could become the best practice in the era of MIDP, thereby enhancing its safety. This trial was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials on June 15, 2024 (jRCTs032240120). © 2024. The Author(s)."
"STK11 germline pathogenic variants are typically associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, hyperpigmented patches, and increased risk of stomach, colorectal, small bowel, and breast cancers (Beggs et al., 2010). Mutations in this gene have also been identified in skin, pancreatic, testicular, and stromal ovarian cancer (Fagerberg et al., 2014). To date, there have been less than 30 cases of ovarian cancer reported associated with mutated STK11 (Bennett et al., 2021). In this report, we discuss a rare case of a STK11 adnexal tumor in a 39-year-old woman previously diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. After 33 months with no evidence of disease following cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC and adjuvant chemotherapy, a new retroperitoneal lesion was noted on imaging. After resection, molecular testing indicated an STK11 mutation, and histology was consistent with an STK11 adnexal tumor. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis of STK11 adnexal tumor due to its non-distinct pathology and IHC staining. Due to the rarity of this neoplasm, analysis of current and future cases of the STK11 adnexal tumor is necessary to understand its pathogenesis, genetic mutational analysis, clinical course, and best treatment options. © 2024 The Author(s)."
"The overall treatment response among patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is poorly understood as most studies report solely on resected patients. We aimed to investigate the outcomes in patients with LAPC as an intention-to-treat-analysis from the time of diagnosis from a complete source population. An observational cohort study in a population-defined region within a universal healthcare system. All consecutive patients discussed at multi-disciplinary tumour board (MDT), aged ≥ 18 years and diagnosed with LAPC were included. Exposure was set as recommended treatment by MDT (i.e. upfront surgery, neoadjuvant therapy, palliative treatment or best supportive care). Outcome measures were overall survival analysed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariable analyses using logistic regression for odds ratios (OR) and Cox proportional hazard analysis for hazard ratios (HR). In total, 8803 MDT events (6055 unique patients) with pancreatic disease were held during the study period. Some 1436 (24%) had pancreatic cancer, of which 162 (11%) had LAPC and 134 met the population-defined criteria. In overall survival analyses, the patients who were recommended neoadjuvant therapy (± surgery) demonstrated no significant difference to palliative chemotherapy (median 11.0 months vs. 11.8 months; p = 0.226). In multivariable analysis, adjusted OR for overall survival comparing the treatment groups was 0.27 (95% CI 0.02-3.29, p = 0.306) and Cox proportional HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.58-1.59, p = 0.865). In patients with LAPC, survival was not statistically different between those recommended for attempt at neoadjuvant (± surgery) compared with those recommended palliative chemotherapy. The findings suggest that conversion/downstaging chemotherapy is successful in only a select few. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Post-transplant HCC recurrence significantly impacts survival, yet its management is challenging due to limited evidence. With recent advancements in HCC treatment, updated data on managing recurrent disease is needed. In this retrospective study across six centers (2000-2022), we employed Cox proportional-hazards regression and log-rank tests to assess survival differences. A prognostic score model was developed to categorize patient survival. Efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was evaluated through propensity score matching. In our study, 431 of 3349 (14%) transplanted HCC patients developed recurrence within a median interval of 18 (IQR:9-32) months. 147 (34%) underwent curative-intent treatments, 207 (48%) received palliative treatments, and 77 (18%) were given best-supportive care. Patients undergoing curative-intent treatments had better survival from the time of recurrence with median survival of 45 (95%CI:36-63) months and 1/3/5-year survival of 90%/56%/43% compared to those receiving non-curative treatments (median: 11 (95%CI:10-13) months, 1/3/5-year survival of 46%/10%/7%, log-rank p<0.001). Patients with recurrence diagnosed in the era 2018-2022 showed improved survival over previous era (HR 0.64 (95%CI:0.47-0.86)). Multivariable analysis identified 5 prognostic factors: ineligibility for curative-intent treatment (HR 3.5 (95%CI:2.7-4.6)), recurrence within 1-year (HR 1.7 (95%CI:1.3-2.1)), poor tumor differentiation (HR 1.5 (95%CI:1.1-1.9)), RETREAT score ≥3 (HR 1.4 (95%CI:1.1-1.8)) and AFP at recurrence ≥400 ng/mL (HR 1.4 (95%CI:1.1-1.9)). These factors contributed to a prognostic scoring system (0-9) that stratified patients into three prognosis groups. Both propensity score-matched analysis and multivariable regression indicated that lenvatinib was not statistically superior to sorafenib in terms of efficacy. Curative-intent treatments should be advocated for patients with post-transplant recurrence whenever possible. Prognostic factors linked to aggressive tumor biology significantly influence survival. Advancements in HCC management have improved survival outcomes over the past five years. Copyright © 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases."
"Patients with synchronous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have not been previously reported in the English literature. We present such a unique case with both PDAC and NPC. A 72-year-old Asian-American female with a past medical history of primary biliary cholangitis presented with abdominal pain. Initial computer tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a 13 cm solid and cystic mass in the pancreatic body and tail with no mass identified in her liver. A biopsy of the pancreatic mass revealed pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma. Further evaluation with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a hypermetabolic mass (SUVmax10) in the nasopharynx. Subsequent biopsy results were consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Genetic counseling and next-generation sequencing (NGS) on her peripheral blood DNA were performed, identifying a pathogenic mutation of ATM c.8545C>T (p.Arg2849*). The patient was treated with gemcitabine-abraxane chemotherapy and FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and irinotecan) for her PDAC, while radiation therapy was proposed for her NPC. Ultimately, due to the progression of the malignancies, she entered hospice care and passed eight months after the diagnosis of PDAC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of synchronous PDAC and NPC in a patient with novel associated pathogenic ATM c.8545C>T (p.Arg2849*) mutation and poor prognosis. More similar case reports are needed to further characterize this entity. Copyright © 2024 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J. Delinasios), All rights reserved."
"This research aimed to assess the value of radiomics combined with multiple machine learning algorithms in the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lymph node (LN) metastasis, which is expected to provide clinical treatment strategies. A total of 128 patients with pathologically confirmed PDAC and who underwent surgical resection were randomized into training (n=93) and validation (n=35) groups. This study incorporated a total of 13 distinct machine learning algorithms and explored 85 unique combinations of these algorithms. The area under the curve (AUC) of each model was computed. The model with the highest mean AUC was selected as the best model which was selected to determine the radiomics score (Radscore). The clinical factors were examined by the univariate and multivariate analysis, which allowed for the identification of factors suitable for clinical modeling. The multivariate logistic regression was used to create a combined model using Radscore and clinical variables. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Among the 233 models constructed using arterial phase (AP), venous phase (VP), and AP+VP radiomics features, the model built by applying AP+VP radiomics features and a combination of Lasso+Logistic algorithm had the highest mean AUC. A clinical model was eventually constructed using CA199 and tumor size. The combined model consisted of AP+VP-Radscore and two clinical factors that showed the best diagnostic efficiency in the training (AUC = 0.920) and validation (AUC = 0.866) cohorts. Regarding preoperative diagnosis of LN metastasis, the calibration curve and DCA demonstrated that the combined model had a good consistency and greatest net benefit. Combining radiomics and machine learning algorithms demonstrated the potential for identifying the LN metastasis of PDAC. As a non-invasive and efficient preoperative prediction tool, it can be beneficial for decision-making in clinical practice.

"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) primarily affects older individuals with diminished physiological reserves. The Modified 5-Item Frailty Index (mFI-5) is a novel risk stratification tool proposed to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to validate the mFI-5 for predicting surgical outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for PDAC. Our retrospective PDAC database included patients who underwent PD between 2014 and 2023. Patients were stratified by mFI-5 scores (0 best - 5 worst), which assess preoperative CHF, diabetes mellitus, history of COPD or pneumonia, functional health status, and hypertension requiring medication. Associations between mFI-5 scores and outcomes, including postoperative complications and mortality, were analyzed using logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Among 250 PDAC patients undergoing PD, 142 (56.8%) had mFI-5 scores ≤ 1, and 25 (10%) had scores ≥ 3. No patients had scores > 4. Higher mFI-5 scores correlated with older age (p < 0.001) and tobacco use (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis identified age (RR 1.02, p = 0.038), ASA class (ASA III; RR 2.61, p < 0.001; ASA IV; RR 2.63, p = 0.026), and moderate alcohol consumption (RR 0.56, p = 0.038) as frailty predictors. An mFI-5 score > 2 independently associated with higher mortality (HR 2.08, p = 0.026). Median overall survival was significantly lower for patients with mFI-5 scores > 2 than for those with scores ≤ 2 (21.3 vs. 42.1 months, p = 0.022). The mFI-5 is a valuable tool for predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality in PDAC patients undergoing PD. Integrating frailty assessment into preoperative evaluations can enhance patient selection and surgical outcomes. Future research should focus on incorporating frailty assessments into surgical planning and patient management to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. © 2024.

"Muscular dystrophies and myotonic disorders are genetic disorders characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration and weakness. Epidemiologic studies have found an increased cancer risk in myotonic dystrophy, although the cancer risk spectrum is poorly characterized. In patients with muscular dystrophy, the cancer risk is uncertain. We aimed to determine the overall cancer risk and cancer risk spectrum in patients with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy using data from the Swedish National registers. We performed a matched cohort study in all patients with muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy born in Sweden 1950-2017 and 50 matched comparisons by sex, year of birth, and birth county per individual. The association with cancer overall and specific malignancies was estimated using stratified Cox proportional hazard models. We identified 2,355 and 1,968 individuals with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy, respectively. No increased overall cancer risk was found in muscular dystrophy. However, we observed an increased risk of astrocytomas and other gliomas during childhood (hazard ratio [HR] 8.70, 95% CI 3.57-21.20) and nonthyroid endocrine cancer (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.03-5.34) and pancreatic cancer (HR 4.33, 95% CI 1.55-12.11) in adulthood. In myotonic dystrophy, we found an increased risk of pediatric brain tumors (HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.16-9.01) and an increased overall cancer risk in adults (HR 2.26, CI 1.92.2.66), specifically brain tumors (HR 10.44, 95% CI 7.30-14.95), thyroid (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.70-9.03), and nonthyroid endocrine cancer (HR 7.49, 95% CI 4.47-12.56), endometrial (HR 8.32, 95% CI 4.22-16.40), ovarian (HR 4.00, 95% CI 1.60-10.01), and nonmelanoma skin cancer (HR 3.27, 95% CI 1.32-8.13). Here, we analyze the cancer risk spectrum of patients with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an increased risk for CNS tumors in childhood and adult nonthyroid endocrine and pancreatic cancer in muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, for myotonic dystrophy, we confirmed previously reported associations with cancer and expanded the cancer spectrum, finding an unreported increased risk for nonthyroid endocrine cancer. Additional studies confirming the cancer risk and delineating the cancer spectrum in different genetic subtypes of muscular dystrophies are warranted before considering altered cancer screening recommendations than for the general population."
"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are significantly implicated in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and immunotherapeutic response. However, little is known about the impact of the resident and exhausted status of TILs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single-cell RNA sequencing data was applied to discover resident and exhausted signatures of TILs. Survival outcomes, biological function, immune infiltration, genomic variation, immunotherapeutic efficacy, and sorafenib response were further explored the clinical significance and molecular association of TILs in HCC. Moreover, a candidate gene with predictive capability for the dismal subtype was identified through univariate Cox regression analysis, survival analysis, and the BEST website. Single-cell analysis revealed that CD8 + T, CD4 + T, and NK cells were strongly associated with resident and exhausted patterns. Specific resident and exhausted signatures for each subpopulation were extracted in HCC. Further multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the ratio of resident to exhausted CD4 + T cells in TIME was an independent prognostic factor. After incorporating tumor purity with the ratio of resident to exhausted CD4 + T cells, we stratified HCC patients into three subtypes and found that (i) CD4 residency high low high low The ratio of resident to exhausted CD4 + T cells shows promise as a potential biomarker for HCC prognosis and immunotherapy response and SASS6 may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for prognostic assessment of HCC. © 2024.

"Although atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo/Bev) therapy has been used as the preferred first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), up to 26% of patients do not achieve disease control, suggesting alternative treatments might be more beneficial for such patients. We investigated key predictors for refractoriness to Atezo/Bev therapy, particularly in the first-line setting. We retrospectively analyzed 302 patients with HCC who received Atezo/Bev therapy between October 2020 and September 2022 across nine hospitals in Japan. Refractoriness was defined as best overall response (BOR) of progressive disease or stable disease and a progression-free survival (PFS) of < 180 days (RECIST v1.1). Clinical benefit was defined as BOR of partial/complete response or stable disease with PFS of ≥ 180 days. Baseline characteristics and potential predictors, identified through literature review, were compared between these groups. Stratifications of overall survival (OS), and PFS were also assessed. Refractoriness was observed in 126 (41.7%) patients, while 154 (51.0%) achieved clinical benefit. Due to a significant association between the treatment line and refractory rate, the subsequent analysis focused on the first-line cohort (n = 214; 72 [33.6%] patients showed refractoriness). Among 13 potential predictors, the CRP and AFP in immunotherapy (CRAFITY) score had the best predictive performance, with refractory rates of 24.6%, 44.6%, and 57.9% in CRAFITY-0, 1, and 2 patients, respectively (p < 0.001). OS and PFS were also well-stratified by this scoring system. Approximately one-third of patients were refractory to first-line Atezo/Bev therapy. The CRAFITY score demonstrated superior performance in predicting refractoriness. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Cutaneous malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer and thus, a high mortality has been reported over decades. The prognosis for melanoma varies widely based on several factors, including the stage at which it is diagnosed, the location and thickness of the tumor, the patient's age and overall health, and specific genetic factors associated with melanoma. Therapeutic options include checkpoint inhibitors, regardless of V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B status (BRAF), and targeted therapy (anti-BRAF) in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but predicting which patients will benefit from these therapies remains challenging. Biomarkers like leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, platelets, and other peripheral blood biomarkers have been investigated for their potential to predict responses to ICIs. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) have emerged as potential biomarkers for predicting responses to ICIs. Elevated baseline levels of ctDNA and elevated sPD-L1 levels have been associated with worse prognosis in melanoma patients. High TMB is often associated with better responses to ICIs in melanoma. Here we present a case from our department, of a 57-year-old patient, diagnosed in 2019 with stage IV - pT4cNx cM1 (lymph nodes metastases) and suspicion of lung metastases, BRAF wild-type right hallux malignant melanoma. Due to impressive results, first-line treatment with ICIs nivolumab and ipilimumab was the preferred treatment of choice, which showed a favorable response, with regression of oncological disease after the first cycle, and achieving complete response afterward. Unfortunately, the treatment was discontinued due to severe hepatic and pancreatic toxicity, but the favorable response to immunotherapy has been maintained for four years and is ongoing. Identifying predictive biomarkers is important to achieve the best response for the patient, with minimal adverse events, especially if long-term clinical benefit can be reached.

"Pancreatic cancer, the 12th-most common cancer, globally, is highly challenging to treat due to its complex epigenetic, metabolic, and genomic characteristics. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, USP21 acts as an oncogene by stabilizing the long isoform of Transcription Factor 7, thereby activating the Wnt signaling pathway. This study aims to inhibit activation of this pathway through computer-aided drug discovery. Accordingly, four libraries of compounds were designed to target the USP21's catalytic domain (Cys221, His518, Asp534), responsible for its deubiquitinating activity. Utilizing an array of computer-aided drug design methodologies, such as molecular docking, virtual screening, principal component analysis, molecular dynamics simulation, and dynamic cross-correlation matrix, the structural and functional characteristics of the USP21-inhibitor complex were examined. Following the evaluation of the binding affinities, 20 potential ligands were selected, and the best ligand was subjected to additional molecular dynamics simulation study. The results indicated that the ligand-bound USP21 exhibited reduced structural fluctuations compared to the unbound form, as evident from RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA graphs. ADMET analysis of the top ligand showed promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, good bioavailability, and low toxicity. The stable conformations of the proposed drug when bound to their target cavities indicate a robust binding affinity of -9.3 kcal/mol. The drug exhibits an elevated pKi value of 6.82, a noteworthy pIC 50 In-vitro testing of the top compound (MOLHYB-0436) could lead to its use as a potential treatment for pancreatic cancer.

"Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors and its combination with other anticancer therapies has emerged as a new standard of care because of the encouraging therapeutic effects in various solid cancers. Nonetheless, glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer remain resistant to immunotherapy and represent intractable cancers with the poorest prognosis. We investigated the therapeutic effects of next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells producing IL7 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19; referred to as 7 × 19 CAR-T) in these intractable cancers. Cytotoxic activities and therapeutic effects of 7 × 19 CAR-T were evaluated in vitro and in vivo, in a model using EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)-positive glioblastoma and anti-EGFRvIII CAR-T generated from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or a model using HER2-positive pancreatic cancer organoids and anti-HER2 CAR-T generated from the same patient's PBMC. Anti-EGFRvIII 7 × 19 CAR-T exhibited cytotoxic activity specific to EGFRvIII-positive tumor, induced complete rejection of glioblastoma with massive T-cell infiltration and tumor cell death in the tumor tissues, and consequently prolonged mouse survival. Anti-HER2 7 × 19 CAR-T demonstrated a potent cytotoxic activity against autologous HER2-positive pancreatic cancer organoids and induced complete rejection of autologous tumor along with prolonged mouse survival. Our results suggest that 7 × 19 CAR-T could become a therapeutic option for glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of next-generation CAR-T in an autologous model using patient-derived tumor organoids and CAR-T generated from the same patient's PBMC, in which unwanted allogeneic immune responses are fully excluded. Despite the clinical development of CAR T-cell therapy, its efficacy in solid cancers has yet to be established. This study explored the therapeutic potential and immunologic mechanisms of IL7/CCL19-producing CAR-T therapy in preclinical solid cancer models of glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer. We found that IL7/CCL19-producing CAR-T cells generated from the patient's PBMC showed potent therapeutic effects against the solid cancer model established by inoculating organoids from the autologous tumor tissue. ©2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."

"Pancreatic cancer is a prevalent malignant tumor with rising medication resistance and mortality. Due to a dearth of specific and trustworthy biomarkers and therapeutic targets, pancreatic cancer early detection and treatment are still not at their best. Exosomal LncRNAs have been found to be plentiful and persistent within exosomes, and they are capable of functioning whether the exosomes are traveling to close or distant cells. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that exosomal LncRNA, identified as an oncogene or tumor suppressor-control the growth, metastasis, and susceptibility of pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Promising prospects for both antitumor targets and diagnostic biomarkers are exosomal LncRNAs. The primary features of exosomal LncRNAs, their biological roles in the onset and progression of pancreatic cancer, and their potential as therapeutic targets and diagnostic molecular markers are outlined in this review."
"Conducting""health economic evaluation""is one of the most important issues for the efficient allocation of healthcare costs. Although the Central Social Insurance Medical Council in Japan(Chuikyo)introduced a cost-effectiveness evaluation system for drugs and medical devices in 2019, there are no reports of the system being officially utilized for medical procedures, including surgical treatments. Because it is often required to provide the best possible treatment to save lives, cancer care is an area where it is difficult to adapt""health economic evaluation"". In addition, surgical treatment is more invasive than medical checkups or drug therapy, and complications and hospitalization costs vary widely from case to case, so the cooperation of the medical affairs department is essential in examining medical costs for health economic evaluation. Although QOL surveys are important for the evaluation of invasiveness, there are almost no large-scale studies that reflect the actual conditions of treatment, and none for Japanese and for patients undergoing cancer treatment. It is essential to conduct QOL surveys for future health economic evaluation. We will explain""health economic evaluation""of surgical treatment for cancer, using as examples the results of medical technology evaluation of surgical techniques that we have reviewed. In considering the""health economic evaluation""of surgical treatment for cancer, the medical cost and QOL surveys were considered to be particularly important. We look forward to future research."
"The prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) after tumor resection remains poor, mostly due to a high but variable risk of recurrence. A promising tool for improved prognostication is the quantification of CT tumor enhancement. For this, various enhancement formulas have been used in previous studies. However, a systematic comparison of these formulas is lacking. In the present study, we applied twenty-three previously published CT enhancement formulas to our cohort of 92 PDAC patients who underwent upfront surgery. We identified seven formulas that could reliably predict tumor recurrence. Using these formulas, weak tumor enhancement was associated with tumor recurrence at one and two years after surgery (p ≤ 0.030). Enhancement was inversely associated with adverse clinicopathological features. Low enhancement values were predictive of a high recurrence risk (Hazard Ratio ≥ 1.659, p ≤ 0.028, Cox regression) and a short time to recurrence (TTR) (p ≤ 0.027, log-rank test). Some formulas were independent predictors of TTR in multivariate models. Strikingly, almost all of the best-performing formulas measure solely tumor tissue, suggesting that normalization to non-tumor structures might be unnecessary. Among the top performers were also the absolute arterial/portal venous tumor attenuation values. These can be easily implemented in clinical practice for better recurrence prediction, thus potentially improving patient management. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"The incidence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms increased dramatically. The clinically optimal management guideline for pancreatic cysts has continued to improve in previous decades. Some issues in diagnosis and treatment require careful consideration and decision-making to achieve the best therapeutic effect and avoid overtreatment. This article analyzes the new progress in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic tumors, surgical decision-making and scope of surgery, and long-term follow-up of patients who have not undergone surgery. In general, the current diagnosis and treatment decisions for pancreatic cystic tumors are more comprehensive and scientific as evidence becomes increasingly abundant, emphasizing the risks and benefits of precise diagnosis and treatment and balanced treatment."
"Germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA) mutation in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) is not common in clinical practice. Therefore, factors that efficiently show gBRCA mutations and the real-world outcomes of olaparib maintenance therapy have not been fully established. In the present study, we clarified the indicators for the effective detection of gBRCA mutation and the efficacy and safety of olaparib as maintenance therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 84 patients with PC who underwent gBRCA testing (BRACAnalysis, Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) at our institute between January 2021 and March 2022. For each patient, clinical data were extracted from medical records. The median patient age was 64 y (29-85 y), and 41 patients (48.8%) were male. The gBRCA mutations were identified in 10 (11.9%) patients; two patients had BRCA1 mutation and eight had BRCA2 mutation. All patients with gBRCA mutation had a family history of any cancer, and eight of them had a family history of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome (HBOC)-related cancer. The gBRCA mutation rate was higher for patients with PC with a family history of HBOC-related cancer compared to that in patients with PC having a family history of other cancers and no family history of cancer (22.9% vs. 4.1%; P = 0.014). In our study, eight out of 10 patients with gBRCA-positive PC received olaparib after platinum-based chemotherapy. The best responses to platinum-based chemotherapy included a complete response in one patient (12.5%) and a partial response in seven patients (87.5%). The median duration of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy plus olaparib was 17.5 months (8-87 months), and the duration of treatment with olaparib maintenance therapy was 11 months (1-30 months). During olaparib maintenance therapy, three patients showed no disease progression. One of these three patients underwent conversion surgery after receiving olaparib for 12 months. The gBRCA testing should be considered proactively, especially in patients with PC with a family history of HBOC-related cancer. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Single large hepatocellular carcinoma >5cm (SLHCC) traditionally requires a major liver resection. Minor resections are often performed with the goal to reduce morbidity and mortality. Aim of the study was to establish if a major resection should be considered the best treatment for SLHCC or a more limited resection should be preferred. A multicenter retrospective analysis of the HE.RC.O.LE.S. Group register was performed. All collected patients with surgically treated SLHCC were divided in 5 groups of treatment (major hepatectomy, sectorectomy, left lateral sectionectomy, segmentectomy, non-anatomical resection) and compared for baseline characteristics, short and long-term results. A propensity-score weighted analysis was performed. 535 patients were enrolled in the study. Major resection was associated with significantly increased major complications compared to left lateral sectionanectomy, segmentectomy and non-anatomical resection (all p<0.05) and borderline significant increased major complications compared to sectorectomy (p=0.08). Left lateral sectionectomy showed better overall survival compared to major resection (p=0.02), while other groups of treatment resulted similar to major hepatectomy group for the same item. Absence of oncological benefit after major resection and similar outcomes among the 5 groups of treatment was confirmed even in the sub-population excluding patients with macrovascular invasion.

"Lenvatinib (dosing for patients who weigh ≥60 kg was 12 mg/day; for patients who weigh <60 kg, the dose was 8 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with first-line unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) in the open-label phase 1b Study 116/KEYNOTE-524 (primary analysis data cutoff date: October 31, 2019; median follow-up: 10.6 months). This analysis (updated data cutoff date: March 31, 2021) reports efficacy results from 17 months of additional follow-up time. 100 patients with uHCC were included in the primary analysis (median follow-up: 27.6 months). Endpoints included overall survival (OS), investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per modified RECIST. Landmark analyses of OS by the best response at 3 and 9 months were performed. Pembrolizumab antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and concentrations were also measured (cutoff date: August 7, 2020). ORR was 43.0% (95% CI 33.1-53.3%) and median DOR was 17.1 months (95% CI 6.9-19.3 months). Median PFS and OS were 9.3 months (95% CI 7.4-9.8 months) and 20.4 months (95% CI 14.4-25.9 months), respectively. No treatment-emergent ADAs were detected. Results show a sustained treatment effect with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with uHCC in the first-line setting. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel."
"To investigate in patients treated for a resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PA), the prognostic value of baseline CA19-9 and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for overall survival (OS), to improve death risk stratification, based on a planned ancillary study from PANACHE01-PRODIGE 48 trial. Biological borderline situation that was first used by the MD Anderson, became a standard practice following the international consensus conference in 2016 to manage PA. Regarding the risk of systemic disease especially in the setting of ""markedly elevated"" CA19-9, neoadjuvant therapy is advised to avoid unnecessary surgery, with risk of early recurrence. To best define biological borderline situations, new biomarkers are needed. Characteristics at diagnosis and OS were compared between patients with or without ctDNA status available. OS was estimated with Kaplan Meier method and compared with log-rank test. Restricted cubic spline approach was used to identify optimal threshold for biological parameters for death risk stratification. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were estimated to assess the association of ctDNA status and other parameters with OS. Among the 132 patients from the primary population for analysis in the PANACHE01 -PRODIGE 48 trial, 92(71%) were available for ctDNA status at diagnosis. No selection bias was identified between patients with or without ctDNA status. 14 patients (15%) were ctDNA+ and exhibited a higher risk for death (P=0,0188; HR95% CI: 2.28 (1.12-4.63). In the 92 patients with ctDNA status available among the others parameter analysed only CA19-9 was statically associated with OS in univariate analysis. Patients with log of CA19-9 equal or superior to 4.4 that corresponds to a CA19-9 of 80 UI/mL were identified at higher risk for death (P=0,0143; HR95% CI: 2.2 (1.15-4.19). In multivariate analysis CA19-19 remained independently associated with OS (p-value=0.0323). When combining the two biomarkers, median OS was of 19.4 (IC 95% 3.8-Not reached) months, 30.2 (IC 95% 17.1-NR) months and not reached (IC 95% 39.3-NR) for ""CA19-9 high and ctDNA+ group"", ""CA19-9 high or ctDNA+ group"", and ""CA19-9 low and ctDNA- group"", respectively (logrank P=0,0069). Progress in the management of potentially operable PA remains limited, relying solely on strategies to optimize the sequence of complete treatment, based on modern multidrug chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX, GemNabPaclitaxel) and surgical resection. The identification of risk criteria, such as the existence of systemic disease, is an important issue, currently referred to as ""biologic borderline disease"". Few data, particularly from prospective studies, allow us to identify biomarkers other than CA19-9. Combining ctDNA to CA19-9 could be of interest to best define biological borderline situations in PA. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Biomarkers for prediction of outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer are wanted in order to personalize the treatment. This study investigated the value of longitudinal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for prediction of overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The study included 45 patients with LAPC who received 5 fractions of 10 Gy on a 1.5T MRI-Linac. DWI was acquired prior to irradiation at each fraction. The analysis included baseline values and time-trends of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and DWI parameters obtained using a decomposition method. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for OS was made using best-subset selection, using cross-validation based on Bootstrap. The median OS from the first day of SBRT was 15.5 months (95% CI: 13.2-20.6), and the median potential follow-up time was 19.8 months. The best-performing multivariable model for OS included two decomposition-based DWI parameters: one baseline and one time-trend parameter. The C-Harrell index describing the model's discriminating power was 0.754. High baseline ADC values were associated with reduced OS, whereas no association between the ADC time-trend and OS was observed. Decomposition-based DWI parameters indicated value in the prediction of OS in LAPC. A DWI time-trend parameter was included in the best-performing model, indicating a potential benefit of acquiring longitudinal DWI during the SBRT course. These findings support both baseline and longitudinal DWI as candidate prognostic biomarkers, which may become tools for personalization of the treatment of patients with LAPC.

"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a prevalent malignant tumor globally, contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality. COAD guidelines label MSI (Microsatellite instability) and MSS (Microsatellite stability) subtypes as global classification criteria and treatment strategy selection criteria for COAD. Various combination therapies involving PD-L1 inhibitors and adjuvant therapy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing in the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Furthermore, the correlation between ATP8B3 and PD-L1 was validated using siRNA, shRNA, and western blot analysis. Additionally, the association between ATP8B3 and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy was investigated through immune infiltration analysis and flow cytometry in both in vivo and in vitro assays. In the COAD patient group, ATP8B3 significantly contributed to the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Inhibiting ATP8B3 led to a reduction in PD-L1 expression in colon cancer cell lines. Additionally, ATP8B3 expression levels could serve as a potential guide for PD-L1 treatment in MSI-H COAD patients, with higher ATP8B3 expression associated with increased sensitivity to PD-L1 therapy. However, due to the lack of immuno-killer cells in the microenvironment of MSS subtypes, elevated ATP8B3 expression couldn't increase the sensitivity of MSS COAD patients to PD-L1 inhibitors. Our research results support that Inhibiting ATP8B3 could enhance TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte) infiltration by reducing PD-L1 expression in MSI-H COAD, thereby serving as an effective strategy to improve PD-L1 blocker efficacy. The treatment strategy of combining ATP8B3 inhibitors and immunotherapy for MSI/MSS COAD patients will be the best choice. Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer. Although it has a high mortality rate, there is currently no effective treatment for HCC. Lenvatinib has traditionally been used as the first-line treatment for advanced HCC (aHCC); however, resistance to this therapy is common. It can be difficult to select effective second-line drugs to overcome lenvatinib resistance when treating aHCC. For patients with aHCC, poor treatment efficacy can result in patients missing the optimal treatment window and can lead to an irreversible situation. Lenalidomide has begun to be used to treat HCC; however, to the best of our knowledge, its efficacy in patients with lenvatinib-resistant HCC remains to be reported on in the literature. The present case report, to the best of our knowledge, describes the first case in the literature of a patient with lenvatinib-resistant aHCC who achieved a partial response after the treatment regimen was switched to lenalidomide. The present case report provides a promising novel route for the treatment of lenvatinib-resistant HCC. Copyright: © 2024 Zhang et al."

"The prognosis of Klatskin tumors is poor, and radical surgery with disease-free surgical margins (R0) represents the treatment capable of ensuring the best long-term outcomes. In patients with Klatskin tumors, both right hepatectomy and left hepatectomy might achieve R0 surgical margins. This systematic review concentrated on a comparative investigation between left hepatectomy and right hepatectomy, aiming to furnish clinical evidence and to aid in surgical decision-making for Klatskin tumor depending on its spread within the bile duct tree. The eligible articles in the study were obtained from PubMed, Medline, and Scopus databases, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, and they were categorized according to the type of Klatskin tumor treated with right hepatectomy or left hepatectomy. The studies that analyzed the outcomes related to the 2 surgical techniques without focusing on the type of Klatskin tumor were included in a separate paragraph and table. In total, 21 studies were included. Four studies reported outcomes of right hepatectomy or left hepatectomy for Klatskin type I/II tumor, 2 for Klatskin type II/IV tumor, 2 for Klatskin type III tumor, and 2 for Klatskin type IV. Eleven studies included the outcomes of right hepatectomy and left hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma without specifying the type of Klatskin tumor. Although long-term oncologic outcomes seem comparable between right hepatectomy and left hepatectomy when achieving R0 resection for Klatskin type III/IV tumors, there may exist a marginal oncologic edge and reduced complication rates favoring left hepatectomy in individuals with Klatskin type I/II tumors. Right hepatectomy traditionally has played a central role in treating Klatskin tumor, but recent studies have questioned its oncologic efficacy and surgical risks. Currently, there is a lack of evidence regarding the ideal surgical approach for each type of Klatskin tumor, and surgical strategy relies heavily on the individual surgeon's experience and technical skills. The management of Klatskin tumors necessitates specialized hepatobiliary surgical centers capable of conducting major hepatectomy with thorough lymphadenectomy, biliary, and vascular reconstructions. There is a need for studies with larger sample sizes to achieve a wide consensus about the superiority of one surgical technique over the other in cases in which both right hepatectomy and left hepatectomy can achieve an R0 margin.

"Primary pancreatic lymphomas (PPLs) are a subgroup of gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas. They are an exceedingly rare entity, both in terms of pancreatic malignancies and also extranodal lymphomas. Epidemiological investigations have been challenging to do because of their rarity. This has resulted in a lack of clarity on the clinicopathological characteristics, differential diagnosis, best course of treatment, and prognosis of PPL. Because the clinical signs are frequently non-specific, it can lead to a diagnostic hazard for the unwary physician. Preoperatively, it is imperative to distinguish between adenocarcinoma and PPL, as they present similarly, but have vastly different treatment modalities and prognosis. We herein present a case of an elderly man who presented with obstructive jaundice and was found to have PPL."
"Significant progress has been made in the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in recent years. In this population-based study, we aimed to compare incidence, therapeutic strategies, and survival outcomes of PDAC patients in France over a decade. This study was performed using a nationwide French database. All patients receiving care for PDAC during years 2009, 2014 and 2018 were included. Treatment modalities and survival outcomes were analyzed. A total of 8143/8771/10494 patients were considered in 2009/2014/2018, respectively. Incidence increased mainly among patients aged >60 years. In localized PDAC, the proportion of patients receiving best supportive care (BSC) only decreased at 43.6/36.4/32.4 % and 27.8/29.1/34.3 % received chemo(radio)therapy alone. The rate of upfront surgery remained stable while 3/8/18 % of operated patients received neoadjuvant therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.0/7.9/8.5 months in the overall population. Among treated patients, 1-year OS was 61.4/67.7/68.8 % and 30.3/36.3/38.8 % for localized and metastatic PDAC, respectively. This study confirms the rising incidence of PDAC. Improved outcomes were seen in localized PDAC, with a wider use of chemotherapy and neoadjuvant strategies, and in treated metastatic patients. A modest survival gain was seen overall, hindered by the still high rate of patients receiving BSC only. Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS."
"Neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is standard for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). However, consensus is lacking on the optimal surgical timing for patients with BRPC undergoing NAT. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing NAT for BRPC and suggest optimal resection timing. Prospectively collected data for 282 patients with BRPC between January 2007 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 164 patients who underwent NAT followed by surgery, 45 for chemotherapy only, and 73 for upfront surgery. Among them, 150 patients who underwent R0 or R1 resection following NAT were investigated to identify prognostic factors. Patients receiving NAT followed by surgery showed the best survival (median overall survival [OS]; NAT followed by surgery vs. upfront surgery vs. chemotherapy only; 35 vs. 23 vs. 16 months). In the NAT group, 54 (36.0%) patients received less than 3 months of NAT, 68 (45.3%) received ≥3, <6 months, and 28 (18.7%) received longer than 6 months. Patients receiving ≥3 months of NAT showed an improved OS compared to <3 months (median; not reached vs. 27 months). In the FOLFIRINOX group, patients who received more than eight FOLFIRINOX cycles showed a good prognosis (<6 vs. 6-7 vs. ≥8 cycles; median survival, 26 vs. 41 months vs. not-reached). However, >12 cycles did not carry a survival benefit compared to 8-11 cycles. The optimal resection timing following NAT is once a patient undergoes at least 3 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or at least eight FOLFIRINOX cycles. © 2024 Japanese Society of Hepato‐Biliary‐Pancreatic Surgery."
"Surgical resection (SR) is the main treatment for small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), but it increases metabolic demand, systemic inflammation, and digestive dysfunction, resulting in major impacts on the postoperative outcomes of patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the postoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI), a surrogate marker of inflammation and nutrition, in patients with SBA after resection. From June 2014 to March 2022, 44 consecutive patients who underwent SR for SBA in Taipei Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Factors associated with survival including PNI were analyzed. PNI decreased in patients after SR for SBA (median change: -1.82), particularly in those who underwent Whipple operation or developed postoperative pancreatic fistula. Postoperative PNI <45.2 best predicted overall survival (OS) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.826, p = 0.001). Patients with lower postoperative PNI had significantly worse OS compared to those with higher postoperative values (median OS: 19.3 months vs not reached, p < 0.001). Low postoperative PNI (hazard ratio [HR]: 11.404, p = 0.002), tumoral lymphovascular invasion (HR: 8.023, p = 0.012), and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 0.055, p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for OS. Postoperative PNI also significantly predicted recurrence-free survival independent of lymphovascular invasion and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 6.705, p = 0.001). PNI commonly decreases in patients with SBA who undergo Whipple surgery or develop postoperative pancreatic fistula. Postoperative PNI independently predicts survival and may serve as a clinical marker to optimize patient outcomes. Copyright © 2024, the Chinese Medical Association."
"Neuroendocrine neoplasms are a diverse group of neoplasms that can occur in various areas throughout the body. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) most often arise in the gastrointestinal tract, termed gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Although GEP-NETs are still uncommon, their incidence and prevalence have been steadily increasing over the past decades. The primary treatment for GEP-NETs is surgery, which offers the best chance for a cure. However, because GEP-NETs are often slow-growing and do not cause symptoms until they have spread widely, curative surgery is not always an option. Significant advances have been made in systemic and locoregional treatment options in recent years, including peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy with α and β emitters, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, and targeted molecular therapies. © 2024 American Cancer Society."
"For reliable DCE MRI parameter estimation, k-space undersampling is essential to meet resolution, coverage, and signal-to-noise requirements. Pseudo-spiral (PS) sampling achieves this by sampling k-space on a Cartesian grid following a spiral trajectory. The goal was to optimize PS k-space sampling patterns for abdomin al DCE MRI. The optimal PS k-space sampling pattern was determined using an anthropomorphic digital phantom. Contrast agent inflow was simulated in the liver, spleen, pancreas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A total of 704 variable sampling and reconstruction approaches were created using three algorithms using different parametrizations to control sampling density, halfscan and compressed sensing regularization. The sampling patterns were evaluated based on image quality scores and the accuracy and precision of the DCE pharmacokinetic parameters. The best and worst strategies were assessed in vivo in five healthy volunteers without contrast agent administration. The best strategy was tested in a DCE scan of a PDAC patient. The best PS reconstruction was found to be PS-diffuse based, with quadratic distribution of readouts on a spiral, without random shuffling, halfscan factor of 0.8, and total variation regularization of 0.05 in the spatial and temporal domains. The best scoring strategy showed sharper images with less prominent artifacts in healthy volunteers compared to the worst strategy. Our suggested DCE sampling strategy also showed high quality DCE images in the PDAC patient. Using an anthropomorphic digital phantom, we identified an optimal PS sampling strategy for abdominal DCE MRI, and demonstrated feasibility in a PDAC patient. © 2024 The Author(s).

"The purpose of the study is to construct meaningful nomogram models according to the independent prognostic factor for metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy. This study is retrospective and consecutively included 143 patients from January 2013 to June 2021. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the area under the curve (AUC) is utilized to determine the optimal cut-off value. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis are exploited to identify the correlation of inflammatory biomarkers and clinicopathological features with survival. R software are run to construct nomograms based on independent risk factors to visualize survival. Nomogram model is examined using calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best cut-off values of 966.71, 0.257, and 2.54 for the systemic immunological inflammation index (SII), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were obtained by ROC analysis. Cox proportional-hazards model revealed that baseline SII, history of drinking and metastasis sites were independent prognostic indices for survival. We established prognostic nomograms for primary endpoints of this study. The nomograms' predictive potential and clinical efficacy have been evaluated by calibration curves and DCA. We constructed nomograms based on independent prognostic factors, these models have promising applications in clinical practice to assist clinicians in personalizing the management of patients. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Chemotherapy offers little benefit and, although there is some evidence that radiotherapy may improve response, its use in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer remains controversial due to conflicting reports on its survival benefit. There has also been a lack of clinical trials that directly investigate the efficacy of radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. The limited progress in the development of radiotherapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer can be attributed, at least in part, to a dearth of preclinical research and our limited understanding of the effects of radiation on the pancreatic tumour microenvironment. In this Perspective, we discuss how insight into the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and the complex signalling between tumour and stromal cells following radiation is needed to develop effective radiosensitising strategies for pancreatic cancer. We also highlight that to have the best chance for successful clinical translation, more preclinical research is required in appropriately complex models. © 2024.

"Both the incidence and prevalence of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours from the small intestine (Si-NET) are gradually increasing. Most patients have non-functioning tumours with subtle GI symptoms and tumours are often discovered incidentally by endoscopy or at advanced disease stages by imaging depicting mesenteric lymph node and /or liver metastases while around 30% of the patients present with symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. Adequate biochemical assessment and staging including functional imaging is crucial for treatment-related decision-making that should take place in an expert multidisciplinary team setting. Preferably, patients should be referred to specialised ENETS Centres of Excellence or centres of high expertise in the field. This guidance paper provides the current evidence and best knowledge for the management of Si-NET grade (G) 1-3 following 10 key questions of practical relevance for the diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. © 2024 British Society for Neuroendocrinology."
"Tumour morphology (tumour burden score (TBS)) and liver function (albumin-to-alkaline phosphatase ratio (AAPR)) have been shown to correlate with outcomes in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This study aimed to evaluate the combined predictive effect of TBS and AAPR on survival outcomes in ICC patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis using a multicentre database of ICC patients who underwent curative surgery from 2011 to 2018. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to examine the relationship between a new index (combining TBS and AAPR) and long-term outcomes. The predictive efficacy of this index was compared to other conventional indicators. A total of 560 patients were included in the study. Based on TBS and AAPR stratification, patients were classified into three groups. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that 124 patients with low TBS and high AAPR had the best overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), while 170 patients with high TBS and low AAPR had the worst outcomes (log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses identified the combined index as an independent predictor of OS and RFS. Furthermore, the index showed superior accuracy in predicting OS and RFS compared to other conventional indicators. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the combination of liver function and tumour morphology provides a synergistic effect in evaluating the prognosis of ICC patients. The novel index combining TBS and AAPR effectively stratified postoperative survival outcomes in ICC patients undergoing curative resection. © 2024 The Author(s).

"We aimed to establish global benchmark outcomes indicators for L-RPS/H67. Minimally invasive liver resections has seen an increase in uptake in recent years. Over time, challenging procedures as laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomies (L-RPS)/H67 are also increasingly adopted. This is a post hoc analysis of a multicenter database of 854 patients undergoing minimally invasive RPS (MI-RPS) in 57 international centers in 4 continents between 2015 and 2021. There were 651 pure L-RPS and 160 robotic RPS (R-RPS). Sixteen outcome indicators of low-risk L-RPS cases were selected to establish benchmark cutoffs. The 75th percentile of individual center medians for a given outcome indicator was set as the benchmark cutoff. There were 573 L-RPS/H67 performed in 43 expert centers, of which 254 L-RPS/H67 (44.3%) cases qualified as low risk benchmark cases. The benchmark outcomes established for operation time, open conversion rate, blood loss ≥500 mL, blood transfusion rate, postoperative morbidity, major morbidity, 90-day mortality and textbook outcome after L-RPS were 350.8 minutes, 12.5%, 53.8%, 22.9%, 23.8%, 2.8%, 0% and 4% respectively. The present study established the first global benchmark values for L-RPS/H6/7. The benchmark provided an up-to-date reference of best achievable outcomes for surgical auditing and benchmarking.

"Parenteral nutrition (PN) can be an effective treatment to improve the nutritional status of patients with pancreatic cancer, but the effects of PN on quality of life (QoL) are still understudied. Therefore, we aimed at investigating whether the best supportive nutritional care (BSNC) in combination with PN at home compared to BSNC alone changed QoL in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy over a period of 7 weeks. n = 12 patients in the PANUSCO study received nutritional counseling only (control group (CG)) and n = 9 patients were also given supportive PN (intervention group (IG)). The primary endpoint was the change of QoL (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26) over 7 weeks between the groups. There was a significant worsening in social functioning in IG (p = 0.031) and a significant difference between groups in change of social functioning (p = 0.020). In all other domains of QoL, there was no significant difference between groups. Within groups, there was a significant improvement in the domain weight loss in IG (p = 0.031), showing that patients were less worried about their weight being too low. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the change of BW over time between groups (p < 0.001) with IG showing an increase (p = 0.004) and CG showing no change (p = 0.578). The administration of PN had in one of five domains negative consequences on QoL. The decision to administer PN should always be made individually and together with the patient, and the impact on QoL should be included in the decision to administer PN. © 2024. The Author(s)."

"This is a case of a 67-year-old woman diagnosed with a 35-mm pancreatic body cancer with a chief complaint of epigastric discomfort. Computed tomography demonstrated invasion of the common hepatic artery, portal vein, and stomach, and chemotherapy was initiated for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. After 9 months of chemotherapy, the tumor remained stable on imaging, and the tumor markers were within the normal range. After additional chemoradiotherapy, the patient underwent a conversion surgery, a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at the time of diagnosis demonstrated main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation on the tail side of the tumor; however, most of the MPD signal disappeared on MRCP after chemotherapy. Surgical findings failed to identify MPD on the first pancreatic resection plane, and additional resection was conducted; however, no MPD was found. As a pancreatic duct anastomosis was not available, pancreatic reconstruction was selected for pancreaticogastric anastomosis using the invagination method. Pathologically, the pancreatic tissue on the tail side of the tumor was replaced by fibrotic tissue, and MPD could not be identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of the disappearance of a dilated pancreatic duct on the tail side accompanied by exocrine tissue loss during preoperative treatment for pancreatic cancer. © 2024.

"Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), complications of portal hypertension, and disease recurrence determine the outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver resection. This study aimed to evaluate the von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF-Ag) as a non-invasive test for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and a predictive biomarker for time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS). The study recruited 72 HCC patients with detailed preoperative workup from a prospective trial (NCT02118545) and followed for complications, TTR, and OS. Additionally, 163 compensated patients with resectable HCC were recruited to evaluate vWF-Ag cutoffs for ruling out or ruling in CSPH. Finally, vWF-Ag cutoffs were prospectively evaluated in an external validation cohort of 34 HCC patients undergoing liver resection. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, vWF-Ag (area under the curve [AUC], 0.828) was similarly predictive of PHLF as indocyanine green clearance (disappearance rate: AUC, 0.880; retention rate: AUC, 0.894), whereas computation of future liver remnant was inferior (AUC, 0.756). Cox-regression showed an association of vWF-Ag with TTR (per 10%: hazard ratio [HR], 1.056; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.017-1.097) and OS (per 10%: HR, 1.067; 95% CI 1.022-1.113). In the analyses, VWF-Ag yielded an AUC of 0.824 for diagnosing CSPH, with a vWF-Ag of 182% or lower ruling out and higher than 291% ruling in CSPH. Therefore, a highest-risk group (> 291%, 9.7% of patients) with a 57.1% incidence of PHLF was identified, whereas no patient with a vWF-Ag of 182% or lower (52.7%) experienced PHLF. The predictive value of vWF-Ag for PHLF and OS was externally validated. For patients with resectable HCC, VWF-Ag allows for simplified preoperative risk stratification. Patients with vWF-Ag levels higher than 291% might be considered for alternative treatments, whereas vWF-Ag levels of 182% or lower identify patients best suited for surgery. © 2024.

"This study was designed to explore and validate the value of different machine learning models based on ultrasound image-omics features in the preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in pancreatic cancer (PC). This research involved 189 individuals diagnosed with PC confirmed by surgical pathology (training cohort: n = 151; test cohort: n = 38), including 50 cases of lymph node metastasis. Image-omics features were extracted from ultrasound images. After dimensionality reduction and screening, eight machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), extra trees (ET), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were used to establish image-omics models to predict lymph node metastasis in PC. The best omics prediction model was selected through ROC curve analysis. Machine learning models were used to analyze clinical features and determine variables to establish a clinical model. A combined model was constructed by combining ultrasound image-omics and clinical features. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and a nomogram were used to evaluate the clinical application value of the model. A total of 1561 image-omics features were extracted from ultrasound images. 15 valuable image-omics features were determined by regularization, dimension reduction, and algorithm selection. In the image-omics model, the LR model showed higher prediction efficiency and robustness, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.773 in the training set and an AUC of 0.850 in the test set. The clinical model constructed by the boundary of lesions in ultrasound images and the clinical feature CA199 (AUC = 0.875). The combined model had the best prediction performance, with an AUC of 0.872 in the training set and 0.918 in the test set. The combined model showed better clinical benefit according to DCA, and the nomogram score provided clinical prediction solutions. The combined model established with clinical features has good diagnostic ability and can be used to predict lymph node metastasis in patients with PC. It is expected to provide an effective noninvasive method for clinical decision-making, thereby improving the diagnosis and treatment of PC. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"To assess the utility of tumor-intrinsic and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and overall survival (OS). PDAC remains a deadly disease with limited treatment options, and both the tumor as well as the microenvironment play an important role in pathogenesis. Gene expression-based tumor-intrinsic subtypes (classical and basal-like) have been shown to predict outcomes, but tumor microenvironment subtypes are still evolving. RNA-sequencing was performed on 114 deidentified resected PDAC tumors. Clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review. Single sample classifiers were used to determine classical and basal-like subtypes as well as tumor-permissive permCAF and tumor-restraining restCAF subtypes. Survival was analyzed using the log-rank test. Patients who received NAT had an increase in OS, with a median survival of 27.9 months compared with 20.1 months for those who did not receive NAT, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio: 0.64, P =0.076). Either tumor-intrinsic or CAF subtypes alone were associated with OS regardless of NAT or no NAT, and patients with classical or restCAF subtypes had the best outcomes. When evaluated together, patients with the classical-restCAF subtype had the best OS and basal-permCAF the worst OS ( P <0.0001). Patients undergoing NAT with the classical-restCAF subtype demonstrated the longest OS compared with the other groups ( P =0.00041). CAF subtypes have an additive effect over tumor-intrinsic subtypes in predicting survival with or without neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in PDAC. Molecular subtyping of both tumor and CAF compartments of PDAC may be important steps in selecting first-line systemic therapy. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are rare neoplasms with an increasing annual incidence and prevalence. Many are metastatic at presentation or recur following surgical resection and require systemic therapy, for which somatostatin analogs such as octreotide or lanreotide comprise typical first-line therapies. Nonetheless, treatment options remain limited. Epigenetic processes such as histone modifications have been implicated in malignant transformation and progression. In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effects of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, entinostat, which was computationally predicted to show anti-cancer activity, as confirmed in in vitro and in vivo models of GEP-NETs. This was a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of entinostat in patients with relapsed or refractory abdominal NETs. The primary objective was to estimate the objective response rate to entinostat. Additionally, with each patient as his/her own control we estimated the rates of tumor growth prior to enrollment on study and while receiving entinostat. Patients received 5 mg entinostat weekly until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The dose could be changed to 10 mg biweekly for patients who did not experience grade ≥ 2 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in cycle 1, but was primarily administered at the starting 5 mg weekly dose. The study enrolled only 5 patients due to early termination by the drug sponsor. The first patient that enrolled had advanced disease and died within days of enrollment before follow-up imaging due to a grade 5 AE unrelated to study treatment and was considered non-evaluable. Best RECIST response for the remaining 4 patients was stable disease (SD) with time on study of 154+, 243, 574, and 741 days. With each patient as his/her own control, rates of tumor growth on entinostat were markedly reduced with rates 17%, 20%, 33%, and 68% of the rates prior to enrollment on study. Toxicities possibly or definitely related to entinostat included grade 2/3 neutrophil count decrease [2/4 (50%)/ 2/4 (50%)], grade 3 hypophosphatemia [1/4, (25%)], grade 1/2 fatigue [1/4 (25%)/ 2/4 (50%)], and other self-limiting grade 1/2 AEs. In the treatment of relapsed or refractory abdominal NETs, entinostat 5 mg weekly led to prolonged SD and reduced the rate of tumor growth by 32% to 83% with an acceptable safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03211988). © The Author(s) 2024.
