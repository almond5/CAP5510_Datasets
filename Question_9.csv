Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease with a 5-year survival rate of 
approximately 10% in the USA, and it is becoming an increasingly common cause of 
cancer mortality. Risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include family 
history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients typically present 
with advanced disease due to lack of or vague symptoms when the cancer is still 
localised. High quality computed tomography with intravenous contrast using a 
dual phase pancreatic protocol is typically the best method to detect a 
pancreatic tumour and to determine surgical resectability. Endoscopic ultrasound 
is an increasingly used complementary staging modality which also allows for 
diagnostic confirmation when combined with fine needle aspiration. Patients with 
pancreatic cancer are often divided into one of four categories based on extent 
of disease: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic; 
patient condition is also an important consideration. Surgical resection 
represents the only chance for cure, and advancements in adjuvant chemotherapy 
have improved long-term outcomes in these patients. Systemic chemotherapy 
combinations including FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid [leucovorin], 
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel remain the 
mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. Data on the benefit of 
PARP inhibition as maintenance therapy in patients with germline BRCA1 or BRACA2 
mutations might prove to be a harbinger of advancement in targeted therapy. 
Additional research efforts are focusing on modulating the pancreatic tumour 
microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of the immunotherapeutic strategies.

Patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are best treated 
with surgical resection of the primary tumour and systemic chemotherapy, which 
provides considerably longer overall survival (OS) durations than either 
modality alone. Regardless, most patients will have disease relapse owing to 
micrometastatic disease. Although currently a matter of some debate, 
considerable research interest has been focused on the role of neoadjuvant 
therapy for all forms of resectable PDAC. Whilst adjuvant combination 
chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with resectable PDAC, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to improve OS without necessarily increasing the 
resection rate in those with borderline-resectable disease. Furthermore, around 
20% of patients with unresectable non-metastatic PDAC might undergo resection 
following 4-6 months of induction combination chemotherapy with or without 
radiotherapy, even in the absence of a clear radiological response, leading to 
improved OS outcomes in this group. Distinct molecular and biological responses 
to different types of therapies need to be better understood in order to enable 
the optimal sequencing of specific treatment modalities to further improve OS. 
In this Review, we describe current treatment strategies for the various 
clinical stages of PDAC and discuss developments that are likely to determine 
the optimal sequence of multimodality therapies by integrating the fundamental 
clinical and molecular features of the cancer.

Remarkable progress has been made in treating pancreatic cancer over the past 
century, including refinement of our surgical techniques and improvements in 
adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. Despite these advances, the incidence of 
pancreatic cancer is rising globally, and it remains a deadly disease. In this 
review, we highlight the historical perspectives of pancreatic cancer treatment 
and outline the areas of future advancement that will assist progression towards 
better outcomes. Areas of future advancement include improving prevention 
strategies and early detection, refining our molecular understanding of 
pancreatic cancer, identifying more effective systemic therapies, and improving 
quality of life and surgical outcomes. Furthermore, systems need to be put in 
place to ensure all patients with pancreatic cancer receive high quality care 
and are given the appropriate options and sequence of therapy. This is best 
achieved through multidisciplinary care.

Pain is highly prevalent in patients with pancreas cancer and contributes to the 
morbidity of the disease. Pain may be due to pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, 
obstruction, and/or a direct mass effect on nerves in the celiac plexus. Proper 
supportive care to decrease pain is an important aspect of the overall 
management of these patients. There are limited data specific to the management 
of pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Here we review the literature and offer 
recommendations regarding multiple modalities available to treat pain in these 
patients. The dissemination and adoption of these best supportive care practices 
can improve quantity and quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Pain management is important to improve the quality 
of life and survival of a patient with cancer. The pathophysiology of pain in 
pancreas cancer is complex and multifactorial. Despite tumor response to 
chemotherapy, a sizeable percentage of patients are at risk for ongoing 
cancer-related pain and its comorbid consequences. Accordingly, the management 
of pain in patients with pancreas cancer can be challenging and often requires a 
multifaceted approach.

CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19-9, also called cancer antigen 19-9 or sialylated 
Lewis a antigen) is the most commonly used and best validated serum tumor marker 
for pancreatic cancer diagnosis in symptomatic patients and for monitoring 
therapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Normally synthesized by 
normal human pancreatic and biliary ductal cells and by gastric, colon, 
endometrial and salivary epithelia, CA 19-9 is present in small amounts in 
serum, and can be over expressed in several benign gastrointestinal disorders. 
Importantly, it exhibits a dramatic increase in its plasmatic levels during 
neoplastic disease. However, several critical aspects for its clinical use, such 
as false negative results in subjects with Lewis (a-b-) genotype and false 
positive elevation, occasional and transient, in patients with benign diseases, 
together with its poor positive predictive value (72.3 %), do not make it a good 
cancer-specific marker and renders it impotent as a screening tool. In the last 
years a large number of putative biomarkers for pancreatic cancer have been 
proposed, most of which is lacking of large scale validation. In addition, none 
of these has showed to possess the requisite sensitivity/specificity to be 
introduced in clinical use. Therefore, although with important limitations we 
well-know, CA 19-9 continues being the only pancreatic cancer marker actually in 
clinical use.

Purpose: To perform real-time whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing 
(RNASeq) of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to identify 
predictive mutational and transcriptional features for better treatment 
selection.Experimental Design: Patients with advanced PDAC were prospectively 
recruited prior to first-line combination chemotherapy. Fresh tumor tissue was 
acquired by image-guided percutaneous core biopsy for WGS and RNASeq. Laser 
capture microdissection was performed for all cases. Primary endpoint was 
feasibility to report WGS results prior to first disease assessment CT scan at 8 
weeks. The main secondary endpoint was discovery of patient subsets with 
predictive mutational and transcriptional signatures.Results: Sixty-three 
patients underwent a tumor biopsy between December 2015 and June 2017. WGS and 
RNASeq were successful in 62 (98%) and 60 (95%), respectively. Genomic results 
were reported at a median of 35 days (range, 19-52 days) from biopsy, meeting 
the primary feasibility endpoint. Objective responses to first-line chemotherapy 
were significantly better in patients with the classical PDAC RNA subtype 
compared with those with the basal-like subtype (P = 0.004). The best 
progression-free survival was observed in those with classical subtype treated 
with m-FOLFIRINOX. GATA6 expression in tumor measured by RNA in situ 
hybridization was found to be a robust surrogate biomarker for differentiating 
classical and basal-like PDAC subtypes. Potentially actionable genetic 
alterations were found in 30% of patients.Conclusions: Prospective genomic 
profiling of advanced PDAC is feasible, and our early data indicate that 
chemotherapy response differs among patients with different 
genomic/transcriptomic subtypes. Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1344-54. ©2017 AACR.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate among all main 
cancer types and is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Australia.
OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the 95% of pancreatic cancers that arise as 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with the aim to summarise current 
recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.
DISCUSSION: No cardinal symptoms for pancreatic cancer exist. Weight loss 
combined with abdominal symptoms or back pain in individuals aged ≥60 years 
prompts urgent computed tomography of the abdomen, while individuals aged ≥40 
years with jaundice require direct specialist referral. Pancreatic cancer is 
categorised as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced or 
metastatic. Resectable disease is treated with surgical resection and adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Borderline resectable and locally advanced disease are treated 
with neoadjuvant therapy, followed by surgical exploration if the disease is 
non-progressive. Metastatic and unresectable disease is treated with 
chemotherapy or best supportive care. Nutritional support is required for most 
patients.

Despite of the predominant role of chemotherapy and surgery in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), radiotherapy (RT) still has a place in multimodal 
management of this disease where local tumour sequelae are fatal in about 40% of 
the patients. RT (chemoradiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy) is used 
and investigated in the non-metastatic setting as part of definitive treatment 
strategies, in (neo)adjuvant settings and for locally recurrent disease. The 
ACROP committee was delegated by ESTRO to recommend target volume delineation 
for these clinical situations. The guidelines of this document are a result of a 
structured evaluation of the best available evidence by a panel of international 
experts in the field. Guidance for treatment planning including diagnostic 
imaging is provided. Recommendations are given for GTV delineation. The role and 
the definition of CTV volumes are critically discussed. Aspects of motion 
management and patient positioning are taken into account for PTV definition. 
Furthermore, aspects of delineation of organs at risk and of dose constraints 
are described in both, standard and hypofractionated, settings. This guideline 
has the purpose to support standardised and optimised processes of RT treatment 
planning for both, clinical practice and prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: The d evelopment of surgical techniques and specialization and 
specifically complication management in pancreatic surgery have improved 
surgical outcomes as well as oncological results in pancreatic surgery in recent 
decades. Historical morbidity and especially mortality rates of up to 80% have 
decreased to below 5% today. This review summarizes the current state of the art 
in pancreatic cancer surgery.
METHODS: The present literature and clinical experience are summarized to give 
an overview of the present best practice in pancreatic surgery as one of the 
most advanced surgical disciplines today.
RESULTS: Based on the available literature, three important aspects contribute 
to best patient care in pancreatic surgery, namely, surgical progress, 
interdisciplinary complication management, and multimodal oncological treatment 
in case of pancreatic cancer. In addition, minimally invasive and robotic 
procedures are currently fields of development and specific topics of research.
CONCLUSION: In experienced hands, pancreatic surgery-despite being one of the 
most challenging fields of surgery-is a safe domain today. The impact of 
multimodal, especially adjuvant, therapy for oncological indications is well 
established and evidence-based. New technologies are evolving and will be 
evaluated with high-evidence studies in the near future.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death. It is 
commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage, when no curative options exist. Over 
the last decade, combination chemotherapy has shown a survival benefit compared 
with single-agent gemcitabine and has become established as first-line therapy 
in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The choice of frontline regimen, which is based 
on clinical factors, plays an important role in subsequent management. Limited 
second-line standard therapeutic options are available. Studies have not 
definitively established that chemotherapy with a fluoropyramidine 
(5-fluorouracil or capecitabine), gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or a 
combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan improves patient survival after the 
failure of first-line chemotherapy. Nanoliposomal irinotecan has been approved 
for use in patients who have progressive disease while on gemcitabine-based 
treatment. Although combination chemotherapy is associated with a modest 
survival benefit, this comes at the expense of increased toxicity and costs. 
Furthermore, the optimal sequencing of these agents in subsequent lines of 
treatment is unknown. Randomized controlled trials provide little evidence of 
greater benefit from second-line therapy compared with best supportive care 
alone. Therefore, treatment decisions should be patient-centered and based on 
functional status, medical comorbidities, and anticipated adverse effects. The 
clinical context and prior treatment-related toxicities have a significant 
influence on the choice of optimal salvage treatment. We review the published 
data focused on second-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly resistant to chemotherapy. 
Effective alternative therapies have yet to emerge, as chemotherapy remains the 
best available systemic treatment. However, the discovery of safe and available 
adjuncts to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy can still improve survival 
outcomes. We show that a hyperglycemic state substantially enhances the efficacy 
of conventional single- and multi-agent chemotherapy regimens against PDAC. 
Molecular analyses of tumors exposed to high glucose levels reveal that the 
expression of GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit), a key 
component of glutathione biosynthesis, is diminished, which in turn augments 
oxidative anti-tumor damage by chemotherapy. Inhibition of GCLC phenocopies the 
suppressive effect of forced hyperglycemia in mouse models of PDAC, while 
rescuing this pathway mitigates anti-tumor effects observed with chemotherapy 
and high glucose.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis and 
high burden of cancer-related symptoms. It is necessary to assess the trade-off 
of clinical benefits and possible harms of treatments with anticancer 
drugs (TAD). This systematic review aims to compare the effectiveness of TAD 
versus supportive care or no treatment, considering all patient-important 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos. Two 
reviewers performed selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We 
assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
RESULTS: We included 14 randomised controlled trials. Chemotherapy may result in 
a slight increase in overall survival (MD: 2.97 months (95%CI 1.23, 4.70)) and 
fewer hospital days (MD: -6.7 (-8.3, -5.1)), however, the evidence is very 
uncertain about its effect on symptoms, quality of life, functional status, and 
adverse events. Targeted/biological therapy may result in little to no 
difference in overall survival and a slight increment in progression-free 
survival (HR: 0.83 (95%CI 0.63, 1.10)), but probably results in more adverse 
events (RR: 5.54 (95%CI 1.24, 23.97)). The evidence is very uncertain about the 
effect of immunotherapy in overall survival and functional status.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is very uncertain about whether the benefits of using 
treatment with anticancer drugs outweigh their risks for patients with advanced 
pancreatic cancer. This uncertainty is further highlighted when considering 
immunotherapy or a second line of chemotherapy and thus, best supportive care 
would be an appropriate alternative. Future studies should assess their impact 
on all patient-important outcomes to inform patients in setting their goals of 
care.

PURPOSE: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which has high expression in 
cancer-associated fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, can be used as a 
theranostic target. Our previous study used 64Cu and 225Ac-labelled FAP 
inhibitors (FAPI-04) for a FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer xenograft imaging 
and therapy. However, the optimal therapeutic radionuclide for FAPI needs to be 
investigated further. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of 
beta-emitter (177Lu)-labelled FAPI-46 and alpha-emitter (225Ac)-labelled FAPI-46 
in pancreatic cancer models.
METHODS: PET scans (1 h post injection) were acquired in PANC-1 xenograft mice 
(n = 9) after the administration of [18F]FAPI-74 (12.4 ± 1.7 MBq) for the 
companion imaging. The biodistribution of [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were 
evaluated in the xenograft model (total n = 12). For the determination of 
treatment effects, [177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 were injected into PANC-1 
xenograft mice at different doses: 3 MBq (n = 6), 10 MBq (n = 6), 30 MBq 
(n = 6), control (n = 4) for [177Lu]FAPI-46, and 3 kBq (n = 3), 10 kBq (n = 2), 
30 kBq (n = 6), control (n = 7) for [225Ac]FAPI-46. Tumour sizes and body 
weights were followed.
RESULTS: [18F]FAPI-74 showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and high 
accumulation in the tumour and intestine 1 h after administration. 
[177Lu]FAPI-46 and [225Ac]FAPI-46 also showed rapid clearance by the kidneys and 
relatively high accumulation in the tumour at 3 h. Both [177Lu]FAPI-46 and 
[225Ac]FAPI-46 showed tumour-suppressive effects, with a mild decrease in body 
weight. The treatment effects of [177Lu]FAPI-46 were relatively slow but lasted 
longer than those of [225Ac]FAPI-46.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested the possible application of FAPI radioligand 
therapy in FAP-expressing pancreatic cancer. Further evaluation is necessary to 
find the best radionuclide with shorter half-life, as well as the combination 
with therapies targeting tumour cells directly.

R. China.

A retrospective study was conducted to analyze which translational therapy, 
palliative chemotherapy and surgery is the best treatment for locally advanced 
and advanced pancreatic cancer, and to screen out the dominant population for 
the best treatment. A total of 83 patients with pancreatic cancer, including 
locally advanced and advanced pancreatic cancer, who had lost the opportunity 
for radical surgery and were admitted to Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital 
between January 2015 and July 2021 were collected. A total of 39 patients 
received palliative chemotherapy, 25 patients received conversion therapy and 19 
patients tried surgery at the first visit. We conducted survival follow-up and 
prognostic evaluation of 83 patients. The median overall survival (mOS) and 
median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 25 pancreatic cancer patients who 
received conversion therapy were longer than those of pancreatic cancer patients 
who received palliative chemotherapy (mOS: 16 months vs. 9 months, P = 0.001; 
mPFS: 11 months vs. 7.5 months, P = 0.038) and surgery (mOS: 16 months vs. 9 
months, P = 0.018; mPFS: 11 months vs. 5.5 months, P < 0.001). Multivariate and 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age, distant metastasis, and the degree of 
CA199 declined after chemotherapy were independent factors affecting overall 
survival (OS) of pancreatic cancer patients who received conversion therapy. 
Conversion therapy can improve OS and progression-free survival in patients with 
locally advanced or advanced pancreatic cancer to a certain extent. Some 
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have surprising results after receiving 
conversion therapy.

Emerging kinase inhibitors for the treatment of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma.

Bethesda, MD, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest solid organ cancers. In 
the absence of specific warning symptoms pancreatic cancer is diagnosed 
notoriously late. Current systemic chemotherapy regimens extend survival by a 
mere few months. With the advances in genetic, proteomic, and immunological 
profiling there is strong rationale to test kinase inhibitors to improve 
outcome.
AREAS COVERED: This review article provides a comprehensive summary of approved 
treatments and past, present, and future developments of kinase inhibitors in 
pancreatic cancer. Emerging roles of protein kinase inhibitors are discussed in 
the context of the unique stroma, the lack of high-prevalence therapeutic 
targets and rapid emergence of acquired resistance, novel immuno-oncology kinase 
targets, and recent medicinal chemistry advances.
EXPERT OPINION: Due to the to-date frequent failure of protein kinase inhibitors 
indiscriminately administered to unselected pancreatic cancer patients, there is 
a shift toward the development of these agents in molecularly defined subgroups 
which are more likely to respond. The development of accurate biomarkers to 
select patients who are the best candidates based on a detailed understanding of 
mechanism of action, pro-survival roles, and mediation of resistance of targeted 
kinases will be critical for the future development of protein kinase inhibitors 
in this disease.

Immunotherapy is a novel anti-cancer method which employs a different mechanism 
to conventional treatment. It has become a significant strategy because it 
provides a better or an alternative option for cancer patients. Recently, 
immunotherapy has been increasingly approved for the treatment of cancer; 
however, it has various limitations; for instance, it is only suitable for 
specific patients, the response rate is still low in most cases, etc. Colorectal 
cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer are known as three major death-causing 
cancers in most countries. In this review, we discuss immunotherapeutic 
treatment for these three cancers, and consider the option, prospects and 
limitations of immunotherapy. The development of immunotherapy should focus on 
the discovery of biomarkers to screen suitable patients, new targets on tumors, 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the combination of immunotherapy with conventional 
therapeutic methods. We can expect that immunotherapy potentially will develop 
as one of the best therapies for patients with advanced cancer or poor responses 
to traditional methods.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, most notably in 
Europe and North America. Great strides have been made in combining the most 
effective conventional therapies to improve survival at least in the short and 
medium term. The start of treatment can only be made once a diagnosis is made, 
which at this point, the tumor volume is already very high in the primary cancer 
and systemically. If caught at the earliest opportunity (in circa 20% patients) 
surgical resection of the primary followed by combination chemotherapy can 
achieve 5-year overall survival rates of 30%-50%. A delay in detection of even a 
few months after symptom onset will result in the tumor having only borderline 
resectabilty (in 20%-30% of patients), in which case the best survival is 
achieved by using short-course chemotherapy before tumor resection as well as 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Once metastases become visible (in 40%-60% of patients), 
cure is not possible, palliative cytotoxics only being able to prolong life by 
few months. Even in apparently successful therapy in resected and borderline 
resectable patients, the recurrence rate is very high. Considerable efforts to 
understand the nature of pancreatic cancer through large-scale genomics, 
transcriptomics, and digital profiling, combined with functional preclinical 
models, using genetically engineered mouse models and patient derived organoids, 
have identified the critical role of the tumor microenvironment in determining 
the nature of chemo- and immuno-resistance. This functional understanding has 
powered fresh and exciting approaches for the treatment of this cancer.

Despite recent biological insight and therapeutic advances, the prognosis of 
advanced pancreatic cancer still remains poor. For more than 15 years, 
gemcitabine monotherapy has been the cornerstone of first-line treatment. 
Recently, prospective randomized trials have shown that novel upfront 
combination regimens tested in prospective randomized trials have resulted in 
improved patients' outcome increasing the proportion of putative candidate to 
second-line therapy. There is no definite standard of care after disease 
progression. A novel formulation in which irinotecan is encapsulated into 
liposomal-based nanoparticles may increase the efficacy of the drug without 
incrementing its toxicity. NAPOLI-1 was the first randomized trial to compare 
nanoliposomal irinotecan and fluorouracil-leucovorin (5-FU/LV) to 5-FU/LV alone 
after a gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. This review focuses on the current data 
for the management of second-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, presents the most interesting ongoing clinical trials and 
illustrates the biologically-driven future options beyond disease progression.

Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal gastrointestinal tumour. Chemotherapy is 
the mainstay of therapy in the majority of the patients whereas resection is the 
only chance of cure but only possible in 15-20% of all patients. The integration 
of radiotherapy into multimodal treatment concepts is heavily investigated. It 
is now commonly accepted that induction chemotherapy should precede 
radiotherapy. When fractionated conventionally it should be given as 
chemoradiotherapy. Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy emerged as an 
alternative, but will have to be carefully investigated in clinical trials. This 
review aims to give an overview of radiotherapeutic strategies with a focus on 
the latest developments in the field in the context of chemotherapy and surgery.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for more than 90% of all 
pancreatic tumours, is a devastating malignancy with an extremely poor 
prognosis, as shown by a 1-year survival rate of around 18% for all stages of 
the disease. The low survival rates associated with PDAC primarily reflect the 
fact that tumours progress rapidly with few specific symptoms and are thus at an 
advanced stage at diagnosis in most patients. As a result, there is an urgent 
need to develop accurate markers of pre-invasive pancreatic neoplasms in order 
to facilitate prediction of cancer risk and to help diagnose the disease at an 
earlier stage. However, screening for early diagnosis of prostate cancer remains 
challenging and identifying a highly accurate, low-cost screening test for early 
PDAC for use in clinical practice remains an important unmet need. More 
effective therapies are also crucial in PDAC, since progress in identifying 
novel therapies has been hampered by the genetic complexity of the disease and 
treatment remains a major challenge. Presently, the greatest step towards 
improved treatment efficacy has been made in the field of palliative 
chemotherapy by introducing FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan 
and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Strategies designed to raise 
the profile of PDAC in research and clinical practice are a further requirement 
in order to ensure the best treatment for patients. This article proposes a 
number of approaches that may help to accelerate progress in treating patients 
with PDAC, which, in turn, may be expected to improve the quality of life and 
survival for those suffering from this devastating disease.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate and timely treatment 
is imperative for favorable patient outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to 
identify disparities in time to treatment for pancreatic cancer based on 
sociodemographic factors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study used the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 
2019. A total of 423,482 patients with pancreatic cancer were included in the 
study. Time to first treatment, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy were 
analyzed in the context of age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, insurance status, 
income, facility type, geographic setting, grade, stage, and Charlson-Deyo 
Comorbidity score (CDC).
RESULTS: All sociodemographic factors included were found to be significantly 
associated with disparities for time to treatment in at least one of the 
categories studied. Minorities, treatment at academic facilities, and patients 
with a high CDC score had consistently longer times to all treatment 
classifications.
CONCLUSION: The analyzed sociodemographic factors affected time to pancreatic 
cancer treatment. Disparities in time to treatment for pancreatic cancer must be 
studied and understood to ameliorate the impact this cancer has on society and 
assure the best possible care for all communities.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western 
world. Surgery remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of 
overall survival (5-year survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% 
of patients present resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. Hence 
chemotherapy, possibly combined with radiation therapy, remains the only 
treatment option aimed at palliation of symptoms and ensuring a better quality 
of life. Notwithstanding the efforts to find more effective therapies for the 
treatment of pancreatic cancer, significant results have not yet been achieved. 
Increasing interest has focused on integrated treatments, i.e. chemotherapy 
combined with targeted therapies, and a better selection of patients. This study 
examines the principal clinical trials that will help give clinicians an 
overview of the progress made in the systemic therapy for advanced pancreatic 
cancer patients in recent years.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality 
in the United States, with a dismal 5-year survival of only 6% for all stages. 
Surgical resection offers the best opportunity for prolonged survival at this 
time, but is limited to patients with locally resectable tumors and no distant 
metastases. Although only 10-20% of patients present with early stage disease 
are amenable to surgical resection, remarkable advancements have been made over 
the past several decades leading to improved morbidity and mortality after 
pancreatic resection. This article will review the current state of pancreatic 
surgery including its role in the multidisciplinary approach to pancreatic 
cancer treatment, advances and controversies in surgical technique, and the 
limitations of surgical therapy that will need to be addressed in the future to 
improve survival for patients with pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: For pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), no studies have established 
any association between earlier treatment initiation and long-term outcomes. In 
addition, an optimal type of initial treatment for the localized disease remains 
ill-defined.
METHODS: Patients in the National Cancer Database (2004-2015) with clinical 
stage I (CS-I) and II (CS-II) PDAC who underwent curative-intent resection were 
included. Optimal time from diagnosis-to-treatment including neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, or upfront surgery was assessed. An 
optimal type of treatment was evaluated. The primary outcome was overall 
survival (OS).
RESULTS: Among 29 167 patients, starting any treatment within 0 to 6 weeks was 
associated with improved median OS compared with 7 to 12 weeks (21.0 vs 20.1 
months; P = .004). This persisted when accounting for sex, race, and 
Charlson-Deyo score (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; P = 0.02) and on subset analysis 
for CS-I (23.5 vs 21.8 months; P = .04) and CS-II (19.4 vs 18.3 months; 
P = .03). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS compared with 
neoadjuvant chemoradiation (25.6 vs 22.7 months; P < .0001) or US (25.6 vs 20.1 
months; P < .0001) even when accounting for sex, race, and Charlson-Deyo score 
(neoadjuvant chemoradiation: HR, 0.86; P < .001; US: HR, 0.79; P < .001). This 
improvement persisted in subset analysis with NC compared with neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation (CS-I: 28.6 vs 25.0 months; CS-II: 25.0 vs 22.9 months; both 
P < .0001) and to US (CS-I: 28.6 vs 22.9 months; CS-II: 24.7 vs 18.4 months; 
both P < .0001). On multivariable analysis for each CS-I/CS-II, NC remained 
associated with 20% improved survival compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiation 
or upfront surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: For PDAC, initiation of therapy within 6 weeks from diagnosis is 
associated with improved survival, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy associated with 
the best survival compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiation or upfront surgery.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents one of the greatest oncological challenges of 
our century, due to its high mortality and incidence. A group of Spanish experts 
in PC treatment reviewed data available on different therapeutic combinations 
and established consensus on what would be the best strategy in PC management, 
depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery with complete resection may 
produce 5-year survival rates of 18-24%, but definitive control is still 
precarious. In the absence of consensus, the best evidence suggests that 
adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine for 6 months using the CONKO-001 regime 
is the treatment of choice after resection of PC for patients with acceptable 
functional status. This group recommends chemoradiotherapy (CT-RT) in patients 
with factors for poor loco-regional prognosis. However, chemotherapy is an 
option for the treatment of locally advanced PC in patients with good general 
status and in the absence of metastatic disease the recommended treatment is 
CT-RT followed by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. A period of chemotherapy 
followed by consolidation CT-RT may be appropriate, as it allows selection of 
patients with locally advanced disease who may benefit most from combined 
treatment. Erlotinib combined with gemcitabine shows significant survival 
improvement in PC and must be considered an option in the first-line treatment 
of advanced and metastatic PC. The gemcitabine-erlotinib combination is proposed 
as the standard treatment for metastatic PC in patients with PS=/>2. In patients 
with PS<2, gemcitabine-erlotinib is recommended as the first-line treatment 
option, supported by a maximum degree of evidence, without ruling out other 
options, such as gemcitabine-oxaliplatin, gemcitabine-capecitabine or 
gemcitabine alone.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains a devastating disease with a 5-year survival 
rate not exceeding 6%. Treatment of this disease remains a major challenge. This 
article reviews the state-of-the-art in the management of this disease and the 
new innovative approaches that may help to accelerate progress in treating its 
victims. After careful pre-therapeutic evaluation, only 15-20% of patients 
diagnosed with a pancreatic cancer (PC) are eligible for upfront radical 
surgery. After R0 or R1 resection in such patients, evidence suggests a 
significantly positive impact on survival of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 6 
months of gemcitabine or fluorouracil/folinic acid. Delayed adjuvant 
chemoradiation is considered as an option in cases of positive margins. 
Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) is defined as a tumour involving 
the mesenteric vasculature to a limited extend. Resection of these tumours is 
technically feasible, yet runs the high risk of a R1 resection. Neoadjuvant 
treatment probably offers the best chance of achieving successful R0 resection 
and long-term survival, but the best treatment options should be determined in 
prospective randomised studies. Gemcitabine has for 15 years been the only 
validated therapy for advanced PC. Following decades of negative phase III 
studies, increasing evidence now suggests that further significant improvements 
to overall survival can be achieved via either Folfirinox or gemcitabine + 
nab-paclitaxel regimens. Progress in systemic therapy may improve the chances of 
resection in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) or locally advanced 
PC. This requires first enhancing knowledge of the genetic events driving 
carcinogenesis, which may then be translated into clinical studies.

Introduction: Despite clinical efforts, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
has a dismal prognosis. The scarcity of effective therapies can be reflected by 
the lack of reliable biomarkers to adapt anticancer drugs prescription to 
tumors' and patients' features. Areas covered: Pharmacogenetics should provide 
the way to select patients who may benefit from a specific therapy that best 
matches individual and tumor genetic profile, but it has not yet led to gains in 
outcome. This review describes PDAC pharmacogenetics findings, critically 
reappraising studies on polymorphisms and -omics profiles correlated to response 
to gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX, and nab-paclitaxel combinations, as well as 
limitations of targeted therapies. Further, we question whether personalized 
approaches will benefit patients to any significant degree, supporting the need 
of new strategies within well-designed trials and validated genomic tests for 
treatment decision-making. Expert opinion: A major challenge in PDAC is the 
identification of subgroups of patients who will benefit from treatments. 
Minimally-invasive tests to analyze biomarkers of drug sensitivity/toxicity 
should be developed alongside anticancer treatments. However, progress might 
fall below expectations because of tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. 
Whole-genome sequencing and liquid biopsies, as well as prospective validation 
in selected cohorts, should overcome the limitations of traditional 
pharmacogenetic approaches.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a dismal prognosis and surgery 
is the only chance for cure. However, only few of the patients have localized 
tumor eligible for curative complete resection. Preoperative management and 
well-staging of the disease are the cornerstone for appropriate surgery and 
major issues to define the best therapeutic strategy. This review focuses on the 
surgical and optimal perioperative management of PDAC and summarizes updates 
data on the subject.

Pancreatic cancer remains an aggressive disease with a 5 year survival rate of 
5%. Only 15% of patients with pancreatic cancer are eligible for radical 
surgery. Evidence suggests a benefit on survival with adjuvant chemotherapy 
(gemcitabine o fluourouracil) after R1/R0 resection. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
is also a valid option in patients with positive margins. Borderline resectable 
pancreatic cancer is defined as the involvement of the mesenteric vasculature 
with a limited extension. These tumors are technically resectable, but with a 
high risk of positive margins. Neoadjuvant treatment represents the best option 
for achieving an R0 resection. In advanced disease, two new chemotherapy 
treatment schemes (Folfirinox or Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel) have showed 
improvements in overall survival compared with gemcitabine alone. Progress in 
pancreatic cancer treatment will require a better knowledge of the molecular 
biology of this disease, focusing on personalized cancer therapies in the near 
future.

Controversy exist regarding the potential benefit of the neoadjuvant approach to 
pancreatic cancer as limited retrospective data exists comparing pre- with 
post-operative chemoradiation. The optimal treatment approach remains unclear as 
we await prospective randomized clinical trials evaluating the hypothesized 
benefit of the neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer and as there 
has been no proven survival benefit to date. Here we summarize the data 
presented at the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium providing additional insight into the 
potential of neoadjuvant therapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the 
United States. Although surgery remains the only curative treatment, 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy are frequently used. In the adjuvant setting, 
radiation is usually delivered with chemotherapy to eradicate residual 
microscopic or macroscopic disease in the resection bed. Neoadjuvant radiation 
therapy has become more frequently utilized. This article reviews the historical 
and modern literature regarding radiation therapy in the neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant settings, focusing on the evolution of radiation therapy techniques and 
clinical trials in an attempt to identify patients best suited to receiving 
radiation therapy.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is a tumor marker for 
pancreatic cancer. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an experimental 
treatment modality for pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
whether percutaneous IRE lowers the CA19-9 level in pancreatic cancer and 
whether this correlates with improved overall survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients with locally advanced pancreatic 
cancer or local recurrence after resection were treated. Patients with missing 
data, metastatic disease and normal serum CA19-9 before IRE were excluded. This 
left 35 cases for analysis.
RESULTS: The median CA19-9 did not decrease in the cohort after IRE treatment 
(282 U/ml before versus 315 U/ml after; p=0.80). The 25th percentile of patients 
with the best CA19-9 response had improved overall survival compared to the 25th 
percentile with the worst response (mean 13.1 versus 8.1 months, respectively; 
p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: IRE did not lower the level of CA19-9 in pancreatic cancer cases. 
However, a response in CA19-9 was correlated with improved survival.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: With recent changes in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, 
patients' active decision-making has become more important. Nevertheless, it is 
difficult to give patients proper insights into the disease. The purpose of this 
study was to determine associated factors between pancreatic cancer awareness 
and treatment decisions as well as how cancer awareness affects the timing of 
treatment decisions and the desired treatment method.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study that reviewed and analyzed the electronic 
medical records of 110 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 
January 2013 to April 2016. A ""patient with pancreatic cancer awareness"" means 
that the patient was informed of their disease state before making the first 
treatment decision.
RESULTS: Of all, only 63.6% of patients (n=70) were shown to have pancreatic 
cancer awareness before making their first treatment decision. Compared to 
patients without pancreatic cancer awareness, patients with pancreatic cancer 
awareness were younger (65.00 vs. 76.98, t=6.70, p<0.001), were more likely to 
have presented their spouse as legal guardians (42.9% vs. 10.0%, χ2=31.70, 
p<0.001), and spent a shorter time for treatment decision-making (1.6 vs. 10.5 
days, t=4.26, p<0.001). The patients without pancreatic cancer awareness were 
more likely to opt for best supportive care compared to the patients with 
pancreatic cancer awareness (79.5% vs. 28.6%, χ2=31.70, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into cancer awareness. Since cancer 
awareness appears to influence treatment decision, it is necessary to develop 
guidelines to improve cancer awareness of patients.

PURPOSE: Malnutrition is a common problem among pancreatic cancer (PC) patients 
that negatively impacts on their quality of life (QoL) and clinical outcomes. 
The main objective of this consensus is to address the role of Medical Nutrition 
Therapy (MNT) into the comprehensive therapeutic management of PC patients.
METHODS: A Spanish multidisciplinary group of specialists from the areas of 
Medical Oncology; Radiation Oncology; Endocrinology and Nutrition; and General 
Surgery agreed to assess the role of MNT as part of the best therapeutic 
management of PC patients.
RESULTS: The panel established different recommendations focused on nutritional 
screening and nutritional screening tools, MNT strategies according to PC 
status, and MNT in palliative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an unmet need to integrate nutritional therapy as a 
crucial part of the multimodal care process in PC patients. Health authorities, 
health care professionals, cancer patients, and their families should be aware 
of the relevance of nutritional status and MNT on clinical outcomes and QoL of 
PC patients.

Outcomes of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) remain dismal despite extensive 
clinical investigation. Combination chemotherapy provides modest improvements in 
survival above best supportive care, and immunotherapy has thus far not proven 
effective. Nevertheless, growing insight into antitumor immunity and the tumor 
microenvironment has inspired the discovery of novel agents targeting PDA. 
Oncolytic viruses represent an emerging class of immunotherapeutic agents that 
have undergone extensive preclinical investigation and warrant further 
investigation in well-designed clinical trials.

Surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer: the role of adjuvant and multimodal 
therapies.

Surgical treatment in specialized referral centers has improved the prognosis of 
resectable pancreatic cancer considerably despite the generally aggressive 
behavior of this malignancy. At the same time, adjuvant therapy for pancreatic 
cancer has been shown to be effective in providing a survival benefit. However, 
some controversy remains over whether to use chemotherapy alone or combined 
chemoradiation. Few prospective randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) on 
the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation have demonstrated a distinct 
survival advantage of systemic chemotherapy (5-FU/FA or gemcitabine) following 
surgical resection. The most notable published trial is the European Study Group 
for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC)-1 trial. In addition, there are several 
retrospective analyses and two randomized studies on adjuvant radiation and 
chemoradiation. Some of these suggested increased survival rates using 
chemoradiation, which was subsequently widely introduced in clinical routine, 
especially in the United States. RCTs and a recent meta-analysis of these RCTs 
confirm, however, the superiority of chemotherapy over chemoradiation, except 
for a subgroup of patients with positive resection margins. Thus, curative 
surgery followed by adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be the standard 
treatment for patients with resectable, locally confined pancreatic cancer. 
Further RCTs may clarify potential benefits of chemoradiation in the adjuvant 
treatment setting. Moreover, the best chemotherapy, or a combination thereof, 
remains to be determined in large-scale randomized trials.

University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

The surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) has seen sweeping changes 
during the past 5 decades. Up to the middle of the 20th century resection rates 
were below 5%, but the numbers of curative resections for PDAC are now 
continuously increasing due to improved neoadjuvant treatment concepts as well 
as progress in surgical techniques and perioperative management. During the same 
period, mortality rates after pancreatic surgery have decreased considerably and 
are now less than 5%. One of the most important cornerstones of reduced 
mortality has been the concentration of PDAC surgery in specialized centers. In 
addition, the management of postoperative complications has improved greatly as 
a result of optimized interdisciplinary teamwork. Adjuvant chemotherapy has 
become the reference treatment in resected PDAC, achieving significantly 
prolonged survival. Moreover, the concept of borderline resectable PDAC has 
emerged to characterize tumors with increased risk for tumor-positive resection 
margins or worse outcome. The best treatment strategy for borderline resectable 
PDAC is currently under debate, whereas neoadjuvant therapy has become 
established as a beneficial treatment option for patients with locally advanced 
PDAC, enabling conversion surgery in up to 60% of cases. This review article 
summarizes the principal changes in PDAC surgery during the past 50 years.

BACKGROUND: Comparative studies evaluating quality of care in different 
healthcare systems can guide reform initiatives. This study seeks to 
characterize best practices by comparing utilization and outcomes for patients 
with pancreatic cancer (PC) in the USA and Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: Patients (age ≥ 66 years) with PC were identified from the Ontario 
Cancer Registry and SEER-Medicare databases from 2006 to 2015. Demographics and 
treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or multimodality (surgery and 
chemotherapy)) were described. In resected patients, neoadjuvant therapy, 
readmission, and 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality rates were calculated. 
Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves.
RESULTS: This study includes 38,858 and 11,512 patients with PC from the USA and 
Ontario, respectively. More female patients were identified in the USA (54.0%) 
versus Ontario (46.9%). In the entire cohort, US patients received more 
radiation in addition to other therapies (18.8% vs. 13.5% Ontario) and 
chemotherapy alone (34.3% vs. 19.0% Ontario). While rates of resection were 
similar (13.4% USA vs.12.5% Ontario), multimodality therapy was more common in 
the UAS (9.0% vs. 6.4%). Among resected patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 
uncommon in both groups, although more frequent in the USA (12.0% vs. 3.2% 
Ontario). The 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality rates were lower in Ontario 
vs. the USA (30-day: 3.26% vs. 4.91%; 90-day: 7.08% vs. 10.96%), however, 
overall survival was similar between the USA and Ontario.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed substantive differences in treatment and outcomes 
between PC patients in the USA and Ontario, which may reflect known differences 
in healthcare systems. Close evaluation of healthcare policies can inform 
initiatives to improve care quality.

Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which progresses locally and 
surrounds major vessels, has historically been deemed unresectable. Surgery 
alone failed to provide curative resection and improve overall survival. With 
the advancements in treatment, reports have shown favorable results in LAPC 
after undergoing successful chemotherapy therapy or chemoradiation therapy 
followed by surgical resection, so-called ""conversion surgery"", at experienced 
high-volume centers. However, recognizing significant regional and institutional 
disparities in the management of LAPC, an international consensus meeting on 
conversion surgery for LAPC was held during the Joint Congress of the 26th 
Meeting of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) and the 53rd 
Annual Meeting of Japan Pancreas Society (JPS) in Kyoto in July 2022. During the 
meeting, presenters reported the current best multidisciplinary practices for 
LAPC, including preoperative modalities, best systemic treatment regimens and 
durations, procedures of conversion surgery with or without vascular resections, 
biomarkers, and genetic studies. It was unanimously agreed among the experts in 
this meeting that ""cancer biology is surpassing locoregional anatomical 
resectability"" in the era of effective multiagent treatment. The biology of 
pancreatic cancer has yet to be further elucidated, and we believe it is 
essential to improve the treatment outcomes of LAPC patients through continued 
efforts from each institution and more international collaboration. This article 
summarizes the agreement during the discussion amongst the experts in the 
meeting. We hope that this will serve as a foundation for future international 
collaboration and recommendations for future guidelines.

Pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDA) is infamously moving 
to the top of the list as one of the most lethal cancers with an overall 5 year 
survival rate of 7%. Multiple genomic-based and molecular characterization 
studies of PDA specimens and established animal models have provided the field 
with multiple targets and a progression model of this disease. Still, to date, 
the best therapeutic options are surgery and combination cytotoxic therapies. In 
general, even in the best case scenario (i.e., an early stage diagnosis and a 
response to a specific therapy), most of these fortunate patients' PDA cells 
acquire or exert resistance mechanisms and eventually kill the patient. Herein, 
we touch on a growing field of investigation that focuses on PDA cell 
therapeutic resistance mechanisms. We examine extrinsic elements (i.e., the 
tumor microenvironment, hypoxia) to the intrinsic processes within the cell 
(i.e., post-transcriptional gene regulation and somatic mutations) that are 
important for therapeutic efficacy and resistance. Even as better targeted and 
personalized approaches move through the clinical trial pipeline the discussed 
resistance mechanisms will most likely play a role in the management of this 
deadly disease.

Palliative and supportive care holds a major place in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) management. It aims to prevent and reduce symptoms and 
hospital admissions, while ensuring optimal health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL), which has been reported to be correlated with overall survival in PDAC. 
Best supportive care includes non-specific treatment of pain, anxiety and 
depression, chemotherapy-related toxicities, as well as thromboembolic disease 
treatment and prevention in high-risk patients. Moreover, nutrition and physical 
activity interventions are receiving increasing attention as they are crucial to 
optimize treatment tolerance and efficacy. Of note, they require adaptation to 
the specificities of PDAC setting and stage of the disease. In this review, we 
propose an overview of palliative and supportive care interventions in PDAC, 
with a highlight on nutritional and physical activity management.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 
the United States and has a median 5-year survival rate less than 5%. Although 
surgery offers the best chance for a cure for pancreatic cancer, less than 20% 
of patients are eligible for potentially curative resection, because in most 
cases, the cancer has already spread locally or to distant organs at diagnosis, 
precluding resection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding, endogenous, 
single-stranded RNAs that are pivotal regulators of posttranscriptional gene 
expression. Extensive studies of miRNAs over the past several years have 
revealed that the expression of miRNAs is frequently deregulated in pancreatic 
cancer patients and that this deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis and 
aggressiveness of the disease. Currently, investigators are studying the use of 
miRNAs as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic tools for 
pancreatic cancer. Rapid discovery of many miRNA targets and their relevant 
pathways has contributed to the development of miRNA-based therapeutics. In 
particular, the transcription factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is overexpressed in 
the majority of cancer patients, including those with pancreatic cancer. This 
overexpression is implicated to have a role in tumorigenesis, progression, and 
metastasis. This important role of FOXM1 affirms its usefulness in therapeutic 
interventions for pancreatic cancer. In this review, we summarize the current 
knowledge and concepts concerning the involvement of miRNAs and FOXM1 in 
pancreatic cancer development and describe the roles of the miRNA-FOXM1 
signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. Additionally, 
we describe some of the technical challenges in the use of the miRNA-FOXM1 
signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer treatment.

CONTEXT: Pancreatic cancer is noteworthy in that the number of patients dying 
from the disease is roughly equal to the number diagnosed. For more than a 
decade, gemcitabine has constituted the standard of care for the palliative 
treatment of the majority of patients who present with metastatic or relapsed 
disease, although the survival gains are limited. Despite a median survival of 
less than 6 months, there is a significant proportion of advanced pancreatic 
cancer patients who progress on gemcitabine that remains fit and these patients 
are candidates for second-line treatment.
METHODS: The OVID MEDLINE database was searched from 1950 to present using the 
MeSH terms ""pancreatic neoplasms"", ""drug treatment"" and ""gemcitabine"". After 
excluding non-relevant results, 31 published studies were identified. These 
results were supplemented by searching the last three (2007-2009) American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Proceedings of Annual Meetings for studies 
published only in abstract form and reviewing reference lists of published 
articles.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The evidence for second line treatments of metastatic 
pancreatic cancer consists mostly of single arm, small phase II studies. 
Oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combinations appear promising and have shown 
increased survival compared to best supportive care. As the molecular pathways 
governing pancreatic cancer are unravelled, novel targeted therapies may offer 
the greatest promise for this disease either given alone, combined with one 
another, or with cytotoxic agents. The need for further, collaborative research 
is emphasised.

Managing patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) is a 
challenging proposition for any treating oncologist. Although the potency of 
first-line therapies has improved with the approvals of FOLFIRINOX and 
gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, many patients are unable to derive significant 
benefit from later lines of therapy upon progression. Enrollment on clinical 
trials remains among the best options for patients with mPDA in all lines of 
therapy. At our institution, we routinely check for microsatellite instability 
(MSI-H) and perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of diagnosis in 
all good performance status mPDA patients. Although MSI-H status is only found 
in 1% of patients with mPDA, given pembrolizumab's tissue-agnostic approval for 
MSI-H tumors in later-line settings, it is a viable option when deciding on 
subsequent lines of therapy. Any use of immune therapy in mPDA is 
investigational outside the MSI-H setting. NGS can identify BRCA or other DNA 
damage response (DDR) defects in patients which can predict sensitivity to 
platinum-based therapies and influence choice of both initial and later lines of 
therapy. It can also identify rare actionable genomic alterations such as HER2 
(2%) and TRK fusions (0.1%) and offer patients the option of enrollment on 
clinical trials with agents targeting these or other identified alterations. We 
believe enrolling mPDA patients on clinical trials with immune-modulating agents 
is critical to determine if there are other patient subsets, outside of the 
MSI-H setting, who would benefit from these approaches. Immunotherapy's general 
tolerability and potential to generate durable responses make it particularly 
appealing for mPDA patients. Although single-modality immunotherapy such as 
checkpoint inhibitors or vaccines have not demonstrated efficacy in this 
disease, combinatorial strategies targeting unique aspects of PDA including the 
tumor microenvironment and desmoplastic stroma have shown preclinical or 
early-phase success. Validating these treatments with later-phase prospective 
studies is essential to making immunotherapy a routine component of the 
treatment armamentarium for mPDA patients.

with resectable pancreatic cancer?

The role of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in the management of jaundiced 
patients with resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) is controversial. Obstructive 
jaundice determines hepatic dysfunction which can increase the operative risks. 
Experimental studies demonstrated that PBD could be associated with improved 
surgical outcomes. However, clinical studies did not confirm these findings. 
Initial clinical studies conducted with percutaneous approach failed to 
demonstrate a real advantage for patients undergoing PBD before 
pancreaticoduodenectomy. Overall morbidity was higher in patients undergoing 
PBD, because of procedure-related complications. Similar results were obtained 
with endoscopic PBD. Six meta-analyses have not clarified the role of PBD in the 
management of patients with malignant jaundice undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy, because of lack of uniformity among all the studies 
published. Recently, the results of a large randomized controlled trial 
indicated that direct surgery should be the best therapeutic strategy for 
jaundiced patients with RPC. The debate whether jaundiced patients with RPC 
should undergo PBD continues and the advent of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
added some arguments in favor of PBD. The latter is still considered the first 
step for jaundiced patients when they present with cholangitis, intense pruritus 
or severe jaundice; surgery cannot be scheduled within 7-10 days from the 
diagnosis; neoadjuvant chemoradiation is planned, as part of the treatment. 
While endoscopic PBD is considered the preferred approach, there is still 
controversy about the type of biliary stent which should be used. Emerging data 
support the insertion of short (4-6 cm) biliary self-expandable metallic stent, 
especially if surgery is not immediately planned.

Second-line therapy for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer: is there a 
standard?

Almhanna K(1), Kim R.

Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.

Gemcitabine (Gemzar) has been the standard treatment for metastatic pancreatic 
cancer based primarily on clinical benefits. To date, no standard guideline for 
second-line treatment of pancreatic cancer has been established. Data supporting 
the use of second-line therapy compared to best supportive care is lacking. We 
reviewed the published literature on second-line chemotherapy for pancreatic 
cancer. Most studies were published in abstract form with small numbers of 
patients. No single drug has been studied extensively in this setting. Benefits 
of second-line therapy seem to be modest, at the cost of drug toxicity, and 
randomized phase III trials are still needed. Future studies in the second-line 
setting should not only use response or overall survival as an outcome measure 
but should consider using clinical benefit as treatment endpoints. The 
incorporation of costs, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-benefit analysis 
into these studies should be considered as well.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective 
treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti-cancer therapies have 
been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. 
This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help 
better inform patient and clinician decision-making when dealing with this 
difficult disease.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for 
first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was 
overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression-free survival, 
grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL 
(searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 
2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant 
conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes 
in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently analysed studies, 
and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), 
progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and 
quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients 
with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on 
radiotherapy.We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive 
care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be 
included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were 
outdated.Compared to gemcitabine alone, participants receiving 5FU had worse OS 
(HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27, moderate-quality evidence), PFS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 
1.12 to 1.92) and QoL. On the other hand, two studies showed FOLFIRINOX was 
better than gemcitabine for OS (HR 0.51 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60, moderate-quality 
evidence), PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and response rates (RR 3.38, 95% 
CI 2.01 to 5.65), but it increased the rate of side effects. The studies 
evaluating CO-101, ZD9331 and exatecan did not show benefit or harm when 
compared with gemcitabine alone.Giving gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate improved 
OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, high-quality evidence) but increased the rate 
of side effects when compared with bolus dosing.When comparing gemcitabine 
combinations to gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus platinum improved PFS (HR 
0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and response rates (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98) but 
not OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, low-quality evidence). The rate of side 
effects increased. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% 
CI 0.81 to 0.95), PFS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) and response rates (RR 
1.78, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.47, high-quality evidence), but it also increased side 
effects. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitor did not improve survival 
outcomes but did increase toxicity. One study demonstrated that gemcitabine plus 
nab-paclitaxel improved OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84, high-quality 
evidence), PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and response rates (RR 3.29, 95% 
CI 2.24 to 4.84) but increased side effects. Gemcitabine-containing multi-drug 
combinations (GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine) improved OS (HR 
0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79, low-quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 
0.62) and QOL.We did not find any survival advantages when comparing 5FU 
combinations to 5FU alone.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy has recently overtaken the 
long-standing gemcitabine as the standard of care. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine 
plus nab-paclitaxel are highly efficacious, but our analysis shows that other 
combination regimens also offer a benefit. Selection of the most appropriate 
chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult, with 
clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is 
essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients.

The most common form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC), has a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Radical surgical 
resection, in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy, provides the best option 
for long-term patient survival. However, only approximately 20% of patients are 
resectable at the time of diagnosis, due to locally advanced or metastatic 
disease. There is an urgent need for the identification of new, specific, and 
more sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction to improve 
the treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients. Dysregulation of 
proteostasis is linked to many pathophysiological conditions, including various 
types of cancer. In this review, we report on findings relating to the main 
cellular protein degradation systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and 
autophagy, in pancreatic cancer. The expression of several components of the 
proteolytic network, including E3 ubiquitin-ligases and deubiquitinating 
enzymes, are dysregulated in PDAC, which accounts for approximately 90% of all 
pancreatic malignancies. In the future, a deeper understanding of the emerging 
role of proteostasis in pancreatic cancer has the potential to provide 
clinically relevant biomarkers and new strategies for combinatorial therapeutic 
options to better help treat the patients.
