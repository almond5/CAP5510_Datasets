OBJECTIVE: The propose of this review to discuss of the systemic treatment 
options for newly diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) including the 
recent data of immune checkpoint inhibitor, CDK4/6 inhibitor and anti-HER2 
therapy. Aim to provide a pragmatic treatment in a gray area or concerning 
issues of real-world practice.
BACKGROUND: IBC is a rare and aggressive disease. Upfront systemic treatment 
followed by surgery and radiation therapy or ""Tri-modality"" treatment is a 
standard of care for newly diagnosed IBC. Due to its rarity, the data of 
systemic treatment for IBC has been extrapolated mostly from non-IBC clinical 
trials.
METHODS: We summarized the recent data of systemic treatment stratified by 
concerning topics and breast cancer subtypes. Some topics are less likely to 
have strong data from IBC clinical trial to supports. Therefore, we interpolate 
the non-IBC data to support our review.
CONCLUSIONS: IBC is challenging in the clinical management. The development of 
novel systemic treatment is urgently needed, especially for IBC-specific 
clinical trials.

Breast-conserving therapy is one of the most remarkable achievements of modern 
cancer care. The authors review the evidence supporting the role of adjuvant 
radiotherapy as the standard of care for breast cancer after breast-conserving 
surgery, consensus guidelines for margins in invasive cancer disease and ductal 
carcinoma in situ, the role of partial-breast irradiation and hypofractionated 
whole-breast irradiation, and the evolving indications for postmastectomy 
radiation therapy and extent of nodal coverage. Areas of research include 
specific methods of partial-breast irradiation, interactions between neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and integration of molecular profiles with the 
selection of the best treatment modality and timing.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disorder with different molecular subtypes and 
biological characteristics for which there are diverse therapeutic approaches 
and clinical outcomes specific to any molecular subtype. It is a global health 
concern due to a lack of efficient therapy regimens that might be used for all 
disease subtypes. Therefore, treatment customization for each patient depending 
on molecular characteristics should be considered. Precision medicine for breast 
cancer is an approach to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the disease 
that takes into consideration the patient's genetic makeup. Precision medicine 
provides the promise of highly individualized treatment, in which each 
individual breast cancer patient receives the most appropriate diagnostics and 
targeted therapies based on the genetic profile of cancer. The knowledge about 
the molecular features and development of breast cancer treatment approaches has 
increased, which led to the development of new targeted therapeutics. Tumor 
genomic profiling is the standard of care for breast cancer that could 
contribute to taking steps to better management of malignancies. It holds great 
promise for accurate prognostication, prediction of response to common systemic 
therapies, and individualized monitoring of the disease. The emergence of 
targeted treatment has significantly enhanced the survival of patients with 
breast cancer and contributed to reducing the economic costs of the health 
system. In this review, we summarized the therapeutic approaches associated with 
the molecular classification of breast cancer to help the best treatment 
selection specific to the target patient.

With increasing life expectancy and growth of the elderly US population, it 
becomes paramount that breast cancer research focuses more on the prevention, 
screening, and treatment of these patients. Age is no longer a cutoff for 
managing breast cancer in the elderly. Studies have shown the current 
undertreatment of cancer undermines survival, but the tide is turning to provide 
evidence-based medicine for the elderly. More often, clinicians and surgeons 
look not only at tumor-specific characteristics of breast cancer but also the 
functionality, tolerance, comorbidities, and life expectancy of patients to 
determine the best treatment.

The objective of this literature review is to describe the types of tumor 
heterogeneity in breast cancer and their clinical implication. Two kinds of 
tumor heterogeneity are described: intertumor heterogeneity and intra-tumor 
heterogeneity. In breast cancer, inter-tumor heterogeneity was best 
characterized in the 2000s thanks to high throughput analyses. These analyzes 
resulted in a molecular classification of breast cancers distinguishing four 
subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER 2+ and basal like. This variability may be 
observed between the primary tumor and metastases, namely the temporal 
intratumor heterogeneity. The average discrepancy for the progesterone receptor, 
estrogen, and between HER2 status appears to be 33%, 20% and 8%, respectively. 
It is then interesting to study the heterogeneity within the primary tumor: this 
spatial intra-tumor heterogeneity is poorly known. Physiopathology of 
intra-tumor heterogeneity light be deciphered by studies on cancer stem cells 
and clonal evolution model. In addition, the tumor microenvironment seems to 
actively contribute to this heterogeneity. The major interest to study this 
heterogeneity is the clinical implication that could result. While precision 
medicine is emerging, it is important to capture the heterogeneity of each 
specific tumor type. These new biological knowledge will allow us to anticipate 
such heterogeneity and individualize the management of breast cancer.

Breast Cancer Immunotherapy: Facts and Hopes.

Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the management of multiple solid tumors, and 
early data have revealed the clinical activity of programmed cell 
death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) antagonists in small numbers of 
patients with metastatic breast cancer. Clinical activity appears more likely if 
the tumor is triple negative, PD-L1+, and/or harbors higher levels of 
tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Responses to atezolizumab and pembrolizumab 
appear to be durable in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 
suggesting that these agents may transform the lives of responding patients. 
Current clinical efforts are focused on developing immunotherapy combinations 
that convert nonresponders to responders, deepen those responses that do occur, 
and surmount acquired resistance to immunotherapy. Identifying biomarkers that 
can predict the potential for response to single-agent immunotherapy, identify 
the best immunotherapy combinations for a particular patient, and guide salvage 
immunotherapy in patients with progressive disease are high priorities for 
clinical development. Smart clinical trials testing rational immunotherapy 
combinations that include robust biomarker evaluations will accelerate clinical 
progress, moving us closer to effective immunotherapy for almost all patients 
with breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 24(3); 511-20. ©2017 AACR.

Women are increasingly surviving breast cancer, but up to 90% experience 
unexpected long-term sequelae as a result of treatment. Symptoms may include 
physical, functional, emotional, and psychosocial changes that can dramatically 
alter the quality of life for breast cancer survivors. Primary care clinicians, 
including midwives, are likely to care for these women and should be familiar 
with common symptoms, treatment, and best practices to avoid permanent 
dysfunction. A holistic approach to assessment, treatment, and referral as 
needed is the most effective strategy. Although women experience significant 
changes after breast cancer treatment, many fail to receive thorough assessment 
of their symptoms, education about interventions, and treatment options to 
optimize health promoting strategies. Disparities exist in treatment 
availability, options, and survivorship. Long-term physical changes include 
anatomic changes, chronic pain, phantom breast pain, axillary web syndrome, and 
lymphedema. In addition, women may have decreased strength, aerobic capacity, 
mobility, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. Emotional and psychosocial changes 
include depression, anxiety, fatigue, concerns about body image, and issues with 
sexuality. Treatment should be multifactorial based on thorough assessment of 
symptoms and can include medication, exercise, counseling, physical and 
occupational therapy, and alternative and complementary therapies. Primary care 
and gynecologic clinicians are well positioned to provide thorough evaluation, 
education, treatment, and referral for the most common sequelae of mastectomy 
and breast cancer treatments.

Novel systemic therapies for breast cancer are being rapidly implemented into 
clinical practice. These drugs often have different mechanisms of action and 
side-effect profiles compared with traditional chemotherapy. Underpinning 
practice-changing clinical trials focused on the systemic therapies under 
investigation, thus there are sparse data available on radiotherapy. Integration 
of these new systemic therapies with radiotherapy is therefore challenging. 
Given this rapid, transformative change in breast cancer multimodal management, 
the multidisciplinary community must unite to ensure optimal, safe, and 
equitable treatment for all patients. The aim of this collaborative group of 
radiation, clinical, and medical oncologists, basic and translational 
scientists, and patient advocates was to: scope, synthesise, and summarise the 
literature on integrating novel drugs with radiotherapy for breast cancer; 
produce consensus statements on drug-radiotherapy integration, where specific 
evidence is lacking; and make best-practice recommendations for recording of 
radiotherapy data and quality assurance for subsequent studies testing novel 
drugs.

This historical surgical retrospection focuses on the temporal de-escalation 
axillary surgery, focusing on the unceasing efforts of researchers toward new 
challenges, as documented by extensive studies and trials. Axillary surgery has 
evolved, aiming to offer the best oncologic treatment and improve the quality of 
life of women. Axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND) has been replaced by 
sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) in women with early clinically node-negative 
breast cancer, providing adequate axillary nodal staging information with 
minimal morbidity, and becoming the standard of care in the management of breast 
cancer. However, this is only the beginning. Strategies in defining systemic and 
radiotherapeutic treatments have gradually been optimized, offering increasingly 
refined and targeted breast cancer treatment tools. In recent years, the 
paradigm of completion ALND after a positive SLNB has been questioned, and 
several studies have led to revolutionary changes in clinical practice. 
Moreover, the increasingly pivotal role played by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) 
has had a profound effect on the extent of axillary surgery, paving the way to a 
more finite ""targeted"" procedure in women with node-positive breast cancer who 
convert to negative nodes clinically after NAC. The utility of SLNB itself and 
its subsequent omission in women with negative nodes clinically and breast 
conservative surgery is also under scientific evaluation. The changes over time 
in the surgical approach to breast cancer have been numerous and significant. 
The novel emerging perspective characterized by recent advances in biology and 
genetics, in dedicated axillary ultrasound imaging and chemotherapy regimens, is 
the present reality that points to the future of axillary node treatment in 
breast cancer.

The improvement of tumor biomarkers prepared for clinical use is a long process. 
A good biomarker should predict not only prognosis but also the response to 
therapies. In this review, we describe the biomarkers of neoadjuvant/adjuvant 
chemotherapy for breast cancer, considering different breast cancer subtypes. In 
hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative 
breast cancers, various genomic markers highly associated with proliferation 
have been tested. Among them, only two genomic signatures, the 21-gene 
recurrence score and 70-gene signature, have been reported in prospective 
randomized clinical trials and met the primary endpoint. However, these genomic 
markers did not suffice in HER2-positive and triple-negative (TN) breast 
cancers, which present only classical clinical and pathological information 
(tumor size, nodal or distant metastatic status) for decision making in the 
adjuvant setting in daily clinic. Recently, patients with residual invasive 
cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at a high-risk of recurrence for 
metastasis, which, in turn, make these patients best applicants for clinical 
trials. Two clinical trials have shown improved outcomes with post-operative 
capecitabine and ado-trastuzumab emtansine treatment in patients with either TN 
or HER2-positive breast cancer, respectively, who had residual disease after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) 
have been reported to have a predictive value for prognosis and response to 
chemotherapy from the retrospective analyses. So far, TILs have to not be used 
to either withhold or prescribe chemotherapy based on the absence of 
standardized evaluation guidelines and confirmed information. To overcome the 
low reproducibility of evaluations of TILs, gene signatures or digital image 
analysis and machine learning algorithms with artificial intelligence may be 
useful for standardization of assessment for TILs in the future.

BACKGROUND: Young women with breast cancer (YWBC) are more likely to have 
aggressive disease, carry mutations for hereditary cancer genes, and experience 
higher mortality. They also may face reduced fertility because of the toxicity 
of chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVES: This article aims to present a review of YWBC treatments, sequelae 
of treatment, and psychosocial challenges.
METHODS: The authors performed a review of guideline-supported treatment 
options, patient resources, and nursing implications.
FINDINGS: Because of high-risk cancers and a lack of specific treatment 
guidelines, healthcare providers may consider aggressive treatments for younger 
patients. However, studies indicate that the foundation for treatment decisions 
for YWBC are best based on disease stage and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines.

This narrative review analyses the customization of Menopause Hormone Therapy in 
the context of breast cancer risk in women with premature ovarian insufficiency 
(POI) and with menopause at a normal age. Women with Idiopathic POI, FMR-1 
premutation or Turner syndrome, if left untreated, may have lower breast cancer 
risk compared to the healthy age-matched female population. These women should 
be treated with MHT until the age of 50, as the risk of breast cancer is equal 
to that of normally menstruating women. Carriers of BRCA 1 & 2 mutation after 
risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), without a personal history 
of cancer, have an increased breast cancer risk, but may probably be treated 
with MHT till the age of 50. POI resulting from endometriosis or cancer related 
treatment is discussed in a separate paper in this issue. In peri- and 
postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms and/or risk factors for 
osteoporosis in need of MHT, the individual breast cancer risk can be evaluated 
using internet-based calculators. In most women the 5-year-breast cancer risk is 
low (<3%) and MHT is a safe option. MHT should be prescribed with caution in 
women who have an intermediate risk (3-6%) and should not be prescribed in those 
who have a high risk of breast cancer (>6%). Oestrogen-only MHT and 
oestrogen-progestogen MHT containing micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone 
are associated with lower breast cancer risk compared to other combined MHT 
regimens.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women and represents the 
leading cause of cancer death. Radiation therapy plays a key-role in the 
treatment of all breast cancer stages. Therefore, the adoption of evidence-based 
treatments is warranted, to ensure equity of access and standardization of care 
in clinical practice.
METHOD: This national document on the highest evidence-based available data was 
developed and endorsed by the Italian Association of Radiation and Clinical 
Oncology (AIRO) Breast Cancer Group.We analyzed literature data regarding breast 
radiation therapy, using the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) 
methodology (www.sign.ac.uk). Updated findings from the literature were 
examined, including the highest levels of evidence (meta-analyses, randomized 
trials, and international guidelines) with a significant impact on clinical 
practice. The document deals with the role of radiation therapy in the treatment 
of primary breast cancer, local relapse, and metastatic disease, with focus on 
diagnosis, staging, local and systemic therapies, and follow up. Information is 
given on indications, techniques, total doses, and fractionations.
RESULTS: An extensive literature review from 2013 to 2021 was performed. The 
work was organized according to a general index of different topics and most 
chapters included individual questions and, when possible, synoptic and summary 
tables. Indications for radiation therapy in breast cancer were examined and 
integrated with other oncological treatments. A total of 50 questions were 
analyzed and answered.Four large areas of interest were investigated: (1) 
general strategy (multidisciplinary approach, contraindications, preliminary 
assessments, staging and management of patients with electronic devices); (2) 
systemic therapy (primary, adjuvant, in metastatic setting); (3) clinical 
aspects (invasive, non-invasive and micro-invasive carcinoma; particular 
situations such as young and elderly patients, breast cancer in males and cancer 
during pregnancy; follow up with possible acute and late toxicities; 
loco-regional relapse and metastatic disease); (4) technical aspects (radiation 
after conservative surgery or mastectomy, indications for boost, lymph node 
radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation).Appendixes about tumor bed boost 
and breast and lymph nodes contouring were implemented, including a dedicated 
web application. The scientific work was reviewed and validated by an expert 
group of breast cancer key-opinion leaders.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal breast cancer management requires a multidisciplinary 
approach sharing therapeutic strategies with the other involved specialists and 
the patient, within a coordinated and dedicated clinical path. In recent years, 
the high-level quality radiation therapy has shown a significant impact on local 
control and survival of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is necessary to 
offer and guarantee accurate treatments according to the best standards of 
evidence-based medicine.

Breast cancer was traditionally not considered a particularly immunogenic tumor. 
However, recent developments have shown that some aggressive triple-negative 
breast cancers are immunogenic, exhibit a resistance to chemotherapy and have a 
poor prognosis. These cancers have been shown to express molecules identified as 
targets for immunotherapy. Despite the advances, the challenges are many, and 
include identifying the patients that may benefit from immunotherapy. The best 
methods to analyze these samples and to evaluate immunogenicity are also major 
challenges. Therefore, the most accurate and reliable assessment of immune cells 
as potential targets is one of the most important aims in the current research 
in breast immunotherapy. In the present review, we briefly discuss the 
mechanisms of the regulation of checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) in breast 
cancer and explore the predictive aspects in the PD-L1 testing.

Immunotherapy has resulted in unprecedented gains in long-term outcomes for many 
cancer types and has revolutionized the treatment landscape of solid tumor 
oncology. Checkpoint inhibition in combination with chemotherapy has proven to 
be effective for the treatment of a subset of advanced triple-negative breast 
cancer in the first-line setting. This initial success is likely just the tip of 
the iceberg as there is much that remains unknown about how to best harness the 
immune system as a therapeutic strategy in all breast cancer subtypes. 
Therefore, numerous ongoing studies are currently underway to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of immunotherapy in breast cancer. In this review, we will 
discuss emerging immunotherapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment 
including the following: (1) Intratumoral therapies, (2) Anti-tumor vaccines, 
(3) B-specific T-cell engagers, and (4) Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
therapy, and (5) Emerging systemic immunotherapy strategies. For each topic, we 
will review the existing preclinical and clinical literature, discuss ongoing 
clinical trials, and highlight future directions in the field.

Exercise is safe and effective for those living with and beyond breast cancer, 
with evidence supporting exercise guidelines, and position statements from 
international organizations. Despite the clearly recognized benefits of exercise 
for these individuals, many do not participate or maintain recommended exercise 
levels throughout the breast cancer continuum, highlighting the lack of 
translation from research into practice. In addition, discerning how exercise 
can be tailored to address breast cancer-related impairments, so that 
individuals are able to participate safely and effectively, has also not been 
studied extensively. Thus, we propose that implementing exercise screening, 
triage, and referral pathways across the breast cancer continuum may allow for 
increased accessibility and adoption among those living with and beyond breast 
cancer. This paper provides an overview of exercise prescription tailoring for 
common breast cancer and treatment-related impairments, proposes a simplified 
screening tool for identifying physical activity and movement-related 
impairments, and considers how best to channel evidence into practice via 
proposed implementation pathways that may better connect individuals living with 
and beyond breast cancer with exercise oncology resources through screening, 
triage, and referral.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women around the world, having a 
sudden spread nowadays because of the poor sedentary lifestyle of people. 
Comprising several subtypes, one of the most dangerous and aggressive ones is 
triple-negative breast cancer or TNBC. Even though conventional surgical 
approaches like single and double mastectomy and preventive chemotherapeutic 
approaches are available, they are not selective to cancer cells and are only 
for symptomatic treatment. A new branch called nanotechnology has emerged in the 
last few decades that offers various novel characteristics, such as size in 
nanometric scale, enhanced adherence to multiple targeting moieties, active and 
passive targeting, controlled release, and site-specific targeting. Among 
various nanotherapeutic approaches like dendrimers, lipid-structured 
nanocarriers, carbon nanotubes, etc., nanoparticle targeted therapeutics can be 
termed the best among all for their specific cytotoxicity to cancer cells and 
increased bioavailability to a target site. This review focuses on the types and 
molecular pathways involving TNBC, existing treatment strategies, various 
nanotechnological approaches like exosomes, carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, lipid, 
and carbon-based nanocarriers, and especially various nanoparticles (NPs) like 
polymeric, photodynamic, peptide conjugated, antibody-conjugated, metallic, 
inorganic, natural product capped, and CRISPR based nanoparticles already 
approved for treatment or are under clinical and pre-clinical trials for TNBC.

Immune approaches to the treatment of breast cancer, around the corner?

Criscitiello C, Esposito A, Gelao L, Fumagalli L, Locatelli M, Minchella I, 
Adamoli L, Goldhirsch A, Curigliano G.

Immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer can be categorized as either 
(a) specific stimulation of the immune system by active immunization, with 
cancer vaccines, or (b) passive immunization, such as tumor-specific antibodies 
(including immune modulators) or adoptive cell therapy that inhibit the function 
of, or directly kill, tumor cells. We will present the current information and 
the future perspectives of immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer, 
including the prognostic role of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, immune 
signatures, targeted therapies modulating the immune system, and tumor antigen 
cancer vaccines. Active immunotherapy in breast cancer and its implementation 
into clinical trials have been largely a frustrating experience in the last 
decades. The concept that the immune system regulates cancer development is 
experiencing a new era of interest. It is clear that the cancer 
immunosurveillance process indeed exists and potentially acts as an extrinsic 
tumor suppressor. Also, the immune system can facilitate tumor progression by 
sculpting the immunogenic phenotype of tumors as they develop. Cancer 
immunoediting represents a refinement of the cancer immunosurveillance 
hypothesis and resumes the complex interaction between tumor and immune system 
into three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Major topics in the 
field of immunology deserve a response: what do we know about tumor 
immunogenicity, and how might we therapeutically improve tumor immunogenicity? 
How can we modulate response of the immune system? Is there any gene signature 
predictive of response to immune modulators? The success of future immunotherapy 
strategies will depend on the identification of additional immunogenic antigens 
that can serve as the best tumor-rejection targets. Therapeutic success will 
depend on developing the best antigen delivery systems and on the elucidation of 
the entire network of immune signaling pathways that regulate immune responses 
in the tumor microenvironment.

Brachytherapy remains the best irradiation technique to deliver a high dose in a 
small volume. Breast brachytherapy is part of the arsenal of therapy in the 
management of breast cancer. In this article, we present the technical data 
related to multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy to the breast proceeding, 
from the implantation of the vectors to the treatment itself. The indications 
for brachytherapy in breast cancer are boost after whole breast irradiation, 
accelerated partial breast irradiation or selected patients with second 
ipsilateral breast tumor event. The results in terms of efficacy and toxicity 
are presented for each indication. Multicatheter interstitial breast 
brachytherapy remains a major technique for breast cancer treatment.

The aim of this study is to review the current status of reirradiation therapy 
(Re-RT) for locally recurrent breast cancer. The overall outcome of breast/chest 
wall Re-RT is difficult to assess because of the wide range of different 
treatments that a patient may have undergone and the patient's individual 
features. The local control and complete response rates were reported to be 
43-96% and 41-71%, respectively. The combination of Re-RT and hyperthermia seems 
to be related to improved outcomes. Toxicity rates vary between studies, and 
Re-RT is generally well tolerated. Re-RT may be considered an option for 
patients with breast cancer relapse after prior irradiation. Further studies are 
needed to determine the best irradiation volume and treatment modality for 
patients with locally recurrent disease.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) can be used to treat breast 
cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a surrogate marker for improved 
survival. This study examined response in the breast and axilla to NAST and 
identified features associated with pCR.
METHODS: Patients undergoing NAST and surgery between January 2012 and June 2016 
by surgeons at Westmead Breast Cancer Institute were identified. Patients with 
inflammatory or metastatic disease were excluded. Data were analysed to identify 
factors predictive of pCR.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were identified. Mean age was 49 years. Forty-one 
patients had axillary metastases identified prior to NAST. Eighty-three patients 
received chemotherapy alone, six endocrine therapy alone and two had both. 
Thirty-seven patients had mastectomy and 54 had breast-conserving surgery. The 
overall breast pCR rate was 29% higher in patients with triple-negative (50%) or 
HER2-positive (39%) disease and lower in luminal disease (11.6%, P = 0.001). 
Forty percent of node-positive patients became node negative. The only variable 
associated with pCR was tumour biology. Patients with HER2-positive breast 
cancer were more likely to have axillary pCR than those with luminal cancer 
(odds ratio: 28, P = 0.00005).
CONCLUSION: pCR in either the breast or axilla was most likely to be achieved in 
patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancers. In patients with 
luminal cancers, the goal of NAST is best considered to facilitate surgical 
options rather than obtaining a pCR.

Early-stage Breast Cancer: Tailored External Beam Fractionation Approaches for 
Treatment of the Whole or Partial Breast.

Historically, radiotherapy fractionation for early-stage breast cancer primarily 
consisted of 1.8-2 Gy per fraction given once daily to a total dose of 45-66 Gy 
over 5-7 weeks for whole breast treatment. Partial breast treatment employed 
larger dose per fraction (3.4-3.85 Gy) in 10 fractions given twice daily over 1 
week. Radiobiologically, breast cancer is increasingly appreciated as a low 
alpha-beta ratio malignancy that is best treated with larger dose per fraction. 
Over the past 10 years, there have been increasing data from multiple large 
randomized clinical trials that support the use of shorter treatment courses: 
first hypofractionated regimens consisting of 15-20 treatments, and more 
recently, ultra-hypofractionated regimens as short as 5 treatments. 
Simultaneously, data from modern partial breast irradiation (PBI) trials support 
once daily treatment regimens ranging from 1-5 treatments. Shorter treatment 
courses represent less treatment burden on patients, reduced financial impact, 
and potentially improved access to care for patients with transportation and/or 
socioeconomic barriers. Here we review the evolution of whole and partial breast 
treatment regimens for early-stage breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) consists of the 
administration of cytotoxic and targeted drugs prior to breast surgery, with the 
objective of reducing the tumor burden to allow breast conservation. NAC also 
aims to improve long-term treatment outcomes such as disease-free and overall 
survival. To optimize clinical practice with the best available evidence for 
breast cancer patients in the setting of neoadjuvant treatment, the Brazilian 
Society of Breast Surgeons (Sociedade Brasileira de Mastologia-SBM) held a 
consensus conference to develop this guideline.
METHODS: Twenty-two questions addressing relevant breast cancer neoadjuvant 
treatment were previously formulated. The voting panel comprised 25 specialists 
from the SBM. A consensus was established if there was 75% agreement. If there 
was less concordance, after discussion, the consensus was determined by a 51% 
concordance.
RESULTS: The recommendations were based on the best level of scientific evidence 
and the opinion from breast cancer experts, when no such research data were 
available.
CONCLUSION: This manuscript provides updated guidance according to the views of 
the SBM's experts for the clinical practice of breast cancer surgeons. This 
manuscript depicts the summarized recommendations for NAC treatment.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TomoDirect (TD) can only operate in free-breathing. The 
purpose of this study is to compare TD with breath-hold 3D conformal 
radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques for 
left breast treatments, and to determine if the lack of respiratory gating is a 
handicap for cardiac sparing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 patients treated for left breast had two computed 
tomography simulation, in free breathing (FB) and in deep-inspiration 
breath-hold (DIBH). Four treatments were planned: TD-FB, 3DCRT-FB, 3DCRT-DIBH 
and IMRT-DIBH. Dose to PTV, heart, lungs, right breast and patient were 
compared.
RESULTS: A slightly lower cardiac mean dose is found for 3DCRT-DIBH than for 
TD-FB group (1.99Gy Vs 2.89Gy, p=0.0462), while no statistical difference is 
found for heart V20. TD-FB plans show the best PTV dose homogeneity (0.053, 
p<0.001) and the lowest left lung mean dose (5.16Gy, p<0.001). No major 
differences are found for the other organs.
CONCLUSIONS: TomoDirect and breath-hold 3DCRT are complementary techniques for 
left breast treatments: for a minority of patients, respiratory gating is 
mandatory to lower cardiac dose; for the remaining majority of patients, 
TomoDirect achieves better PTV homogeneity and reduced left lung dose, with 
cardiac dose equivalent to 3DCRT-DIBH.

Adoption of urbanised lifestyles together with changes in reproductive behaviour 
might partly underlie the continued rise in worldwide incidence of breast 
cancer. Widespread mammographic screening and effective systemic therapies have 
led to a stage shift at presentation and mortality reductions in the past two 
decades. Loco-regional control of the disease seems to affect long-term 
survival, and attention to surgical margins together with improved radiotherapy 
techniques could further contribute to mortality gains. Developments in 
oncoplastic surgery and partial-breast reconstruction have improved cosmetic 
outcomes after breast-conservation surgery. Optimum approaches for delivering 
chest-wall radiotherapy in the context of immediate breast reconstruction 
present special challenges. Accurate methods for intraoperative assessment of 
sentinel lymph nodes remain a clinical priority. Clinical trials are 
investigating combinatorial therapies that use novel agents targeting growth 
factor receptors, signal transduction pathways, and tumour angiogenesis. 
Gene-expression profiling offers the potential to provide accurate prognostic 
and predictive information, with selection of best possible therapy for 
individuals and avoidance of overtreatment and undertreatment of patients with 
conventional chemotherapy. Short-term presurgical studies in the neoadjuvant 
setting allow monitoring of proliferative indices, and changes in 
gene-expression patterns can be predictive of response to therapies and 
long-term outcome.

Endocrine therapy has significantly improved outcomes for patients with early- 
and advanced-stage hormone-receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Despite the 
success of adjuvant endocrine therapy, some patients with early-stage disease 
will experience relapse. Additionally, all patients with advanced disease will 
eventually experience disease progression on endocrine therapy due to 
resistance. Improved understanding of the mechanisms associated with resistance 
to endocrine agents has recently led to the approval of new therapeutics. 
Multiple questions remain unanswered, including the optimal duration of adjuvant 
therapy, the role of ovarian ablation in early-stage breast cancer in 
premenopausal women, and how to best incorporate targeted agents with endocrine 
therapy in the metastatic setting. This article reviews the optimization of 
endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positive breast cancer, focusing on these 
controversial areas.

OBJECTIVES: Chemotherapy in the neo adjuvant setting has allowed downsizing of 
breast tumours thus allowing patients to benefit from breast conservation 
surgery. The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has also been observed in 
the axilla but most units are still treating the axilla with axillary lymph node 
dissection (ALND).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective database of breast cancer patients 
receiving NAC between 2007 and 2016 at a single breast unit was reviewed. The 
management of the axilla and outcomes was studied.
RESULTS: 165 patients received NAC, 123 (74.5%) were clinically/radiologically 
node positive and 42 were negative. Median age was 50 years. 26.7% had triple 
negative disease and 34.5% were HER2 positive. 56/123 (45.5%) patients with 
positive nodes at the outset responded completely to NAC. 40 patients with 
positive nodes pre-NAC had post NAC SLNB with 37 requiring adjuvant radiotherapy 
only. 83/123 went directly to ALND post NAC and of these 27 were node negative 
and therefore may be considered to have had an unnecessary ALND. Overall 
mortality was 20.6% (34), local recurrence in the breast or mastectomy scar was 
3.6% (6) but there was no recurrence in the axilla (0/165) with a median follow 
up of 67 months.
CONCLUSION: There is no clear evidence for management of the axilla post NAC. We 
have used best available evidence to change our practice over the years and our 
results should encourage others to de-escalate treatment of the axilla in line 
with the recently published multidisciplinary guidance on axillary surgery 
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

In Europe, inappropriate reimbursement and funding rules and regulations act as 
disincentives to best breast cancer care or, at worst, hinder best care. This 
problem was the focus of the 12th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC) 
manifesto, discussed during the virtual conference. As patient involvement is 
indispensable in driving changes to clinical practice, Europa Donna the European 
patient advocacy group was closely involved in the 12th manifesto. Reimbursement 
policies have rarely evolved with advances in breast cancer care such as 
outpatient (ambulatory) care rather than inpatient admission, use of oral or 
subcutaneous anti-cancer drugs rather than day-hospital intravenous 
administration, oncoplastic surgery techniques to minimize mastectomy rates, 
breast reconstructive surgery, risk-reducing surgery for BRCA mutation carriers, 
or use of hypo-fractionated breast radiation therapy. Although each European 
country, region and centre will have to understand how their reimbursement 
policies may hinder best care and find their own solutions, the problems are 
similar throughout Europe and some solutions can be broadly applied. This 
manifesto is not calling for more funding or demanding changes that will result 
in more expensive care. Reimbursement, if better aligned with guidelines and 
optimal clinical practice, will deliver more cost-effective healthcare. This 
will release resources, support more equitable use of finite funding and 
resources, so allowing more European breast cancer patients to benefit from 
evidence-based treatment recommended by national and international guidelines.

The majority of breast cancers are actually diagnosed at an early stage. 
Selection of the best treatment in the adjuvant setting represents a paramount 
step to reduce the risk of recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. At the 
present time decision making is based on individualized risk assessment, that 
takes into account patient and tumor clinical-pathological characteristics. New 
available tools, such as gene expression profiling, offer the potential to 
provide accurate prognostic and predictive information, but they require further 
validation. The present article provides an overview of current strategies in 
adjuvant breast cancer setting, and addresses a number of unresolved questions 
related to the role of taxanes, trastuzumab and hormonal treatment.

Estrogen Receptor-positive/HER-2 negative breast cancers represent a 
heterogeneous group of tumors. Luminal A and B tumor subtypes can be identified 
through immunohistochemical assessment of estrogen and progesterone receptor, 
Ki-67 and HER-2 status. Patients with high levels of expression of steroid 
hormone receptors and low proliferation (Luminal A) are commonly cured with 
endocrine therapy alone. Patients with doubtful endocrine responsiveness or with 
high proliferation index (Luminal B/Her-negative) require the addition of 
chemotherapy to the best endocrine therapy. Controversies still exist on the 
identification of those patients who do not benefit from chemotherapy. Tailored 
adjuvant treatments should be considered in the therapeutic algorithm of 
patients with luminal tumors.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Breast cancer incidence and mortality increase with age. 
Older patients (≥ 70) are often excluded from studies. Due to multiple factors, 
it is unclear whether this population is best-treated using standard guidelines. 
Here, we review surgical management in older women with breast cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Geriatric assessments can guide treatment recommendations and 
aid in predicting survival and quality of life. Surgery remains a principal 
component of breast cancer treatment in older patients, though differences exist 
compared with younger women, including higher mastectomy rates and 
evidence-based support of omission of post-lumpectomy radiation or axillary 
dissection in subsets of patients. In those forgoing surgical management, there 
is increased use of endocrine therapy. Hospice is also a valuable element of 
end-of-life care. Physicians should utilize geriatric assessment to make 
treatment recommendations for older breast cancer patients, including omission 
of radiation therapy, alterations to standard surgeries, or enrollment in 
hospice care.

INTRODUCTION: The development of resistance to therapy is a concern in all three 
subtypes of breast cancer (BC). Yet, outcomes of patients with BC have improved 
in the past few years thanks to a molecularly targeted approach and a greater 
understanding of the many mechanisms through which cancer cells adapt to evade 
drug therapies. Indeed, there have been a number of different and active 
treatment strategies for hormone receptor positive (HR+ and Her2 positive BC 
although triple-negative breast cancer treatment remains problematical because 
of the early onset of resistance to treatments and the limited availability of 
targeted treatment options.
AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors present the various pharmacotherapeutic 
options for refractory breast cancer including their perspectives on these 
options.
EXPERT OPINION: In recent years, there has been significant progress in our 
understanding of the biological mechanisms that cause resistance to BC 
treatments. The targeted therapeutic approach particularly has improved patient 
outcomes for those with refractory BC, but some unresolved issues still remain. 
In particular, we need to identify biomarkers of resistance to better tailor 
treatments, toxicities, and costs. Moreover, we need to determine the best 
sequence of treatments in refractory BC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was once thought to be an 
insurmountable disease marked by a lack of targeted treatments. However, we are 
now witnessing the dawn of targeted therapies for TNBC in which progress has 
stemmed from an improved understanding of the components that make TNBC unique. 
The identification of biomarkers, such as BRCA1/2, PIK3CA and RSK2, have 
advanced the field remarkably and there is considerable interest in finding 
novel therapeutics for TNBC that offer durable clinical benefit with fewer 
adverse events.
AREAS COVERED: We discuss phase I/II trials of new and emerging targeted 
therapies for TNBC, according to ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2020. Although 
the emphasis is on ongoing and completed early phase trials, we also highlight 
pivotal studies that have led to the approval of new targeted classes of drugs 
for TNBC, with a focus on outcomes and common adverse events of each class of 
therapy.
EXPERT OPINION: The way forward for TNBC treatment is through precision 
medicine. The use of novel agents matched with biomarkers to identify patients 
with the best chance of sustainable response offers new hope. We now have great 
potential for improving the outcomes for patients with TNBC.

Breast cancer has been identified as one of the main cancer-related deaths among 
women during some last decades. Recent advances in the introduction of novel 
potent anti-cancer therapeutics in association with early detection methods led 
to a decrease in the mortality rate of breast cancer. However, the scenario of 
breast cancer is yet going on and further improvements in the current 
anti-cancer therapeutic approaches are needed. Several factors are present in 
the tumor microenvironment which help to cancer progression and suppression of 
anti-tumor responses. Targeting these cancer-promoting factors in the tumor 
microenvironment has been suggested as a potent immunotherapeutic approach for 
cancer therapy. Among the various tumorsupporting factors, Cyclin-Dependent 
Kinases (CDKs) are proposed as a novel promising target for cancer therapy. 
These factors in association with cyclins play a key role in cell cycle 
progression. Dysregulation of CDKs which leads to increased cell proliferation 
has been identified in various cancers, such as breast cancer. Accordingly, the 
development and use of CDK-inhibitors have been associated with encouraging 
results in the treatment of breast cancer. However, it is unknown that the 
inhibition of which CDK is the most effective strategy for breast cancer 
therapy. Since the selective blockage of CDK1 alone or in combination with other 
therapeutics has been associated with potent anti-cancer outcomes, it is 
suggested that CDK1 may be considered as the best CDK target for breast cancer 
therapy. In this review, we will discuss the role of CDK1 in breast cancer 
progression and treatment.

The treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Greenberg EJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New 
York.

While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable. Its treatment is 
associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to 
maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several 
years. This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to 
maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are 
available. Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment 
and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities. 
There is still no established ""best"" or ""only"" first treatment of metastatic 
breast cancer. When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task 
of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex. It is 
only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will 
develop. Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the 
patient. Communication must remain open. In the final stages of the illness, 
treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and 
anxiety.

Multimodality therapy of locally advanced breast cancer with initial 
chemo-(hormono)-therapy followed by locoregional treatment has become 
increasingly popular during the past decade. A paucity of large randomised 
clinical trials leaves the following unanswered questions: does systemic 
treatment impact on long-term control of distant metastases? What is the best 
treatment sequence? The most effective drug combination? The optimum treatment 
duration? Future prospects in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer 
include the use of haematopoietic growth factors to increase the dose-intensity 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the investigation of autologous bone marrow 
transplantation with high dose chemotherapy on a larger scale, the development 
of new approaches designed at interrupting the ""autocrine loop"" of breast cancer 
local growth factors and the introduction of diphosphonates in the adjuvant 
systemic therapy.

Hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancers represent the vast majority of 
breast cancers. Adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is highly 
effective and appropriate for nearly all women with HR positive tumors. Adjuvant 
tamoxifen (TAM) is a major endocrine treatment option, which has been found to 
be effective in both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Considerable 
evidence has been accrued of a benefit for ovarian ablation or suppression 
(OA/S) in premenopausal patients, for aromatase inhibitors (AIS) in 
postmenopausal patients, for the longer duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy 
and for the clinical utility of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Clinical practice 
guidelines should keep changing with developing evidence-based practice 
guidelines pertaining to breast cancer care. The present publication conducted a 
comprehensive systematic review of the literature addressing the use of 
endocrine therapy as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for HR positive breast 
cancer, focusing on selecting the best agents for both premenopausal and 
postmenopausal patients, as well as the optimal duration of such treatment.

Current methods for biopsy and treatment of potentially curable breast cancer.

Leis HP Jr(1).

Author information:
(1)New York Medical College, Institute of Breast Diseases, Valhalla.

Concepts regarding the best methods for doing biopsies and the most appropriate 
methods for treatment of patients with breast cancers have changed dramatically 
since the early nineteen seventies. Currently formal biopsies (incisional or 
excisional) are being done as two-step procedures with reliance on permanent 
sections for diagnosis. The advantages of this type of biopsy are discussed 
along with the increasing frequency of doing them under local anesthesia on an 
out-patient basis. Informal biopsies (fine needle aspiration or needle core) are 
becoming increasingly popular in the office and clinic and stereotactic biopsies 
are receiving increasing attention. The use of flow cell cytometry to complement 
cytologic diagnosis and the use of needle localization, with or without dye 
injection, for the biopsy of occult lesions are described. The need for 
determining by prognostic parameters and by scanning the remaining breast for 
residual cancers after radiolabeled monoclonal antibody injection, which in situ 
cancers can be managed by lesser procedures than total mastectomy and which 
early invasive cancers can be managed by just wide excision is discussed. The 
two main current local-regional therapy options for women with invasive breast 
cancers (some type of modified mastectomy with breast reconstruction and breast 
conservation with radiotherapy) are presented in detail. The present need of 
doing an axillary dissection in both for staging is discussed along with the 
future possibility of eliminating it by scanning with a gamma-camera the 
axillary and internal mammary nodal areas after radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 
injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PURPOSE: As older women with breast cancer (BC) are underrepresented in trials, 
it is often unclear what represents the best treatment option for this patient 
group. To understand how oncologists approach the management of BC in older 
patients, we assessed their treatment recommendations.
METHODS: In an online survey, 106 surgical, 37 radiation and 31 medical 
oncologists provided a treatment recommendation for hypothetical patients aged 
>70 years. Scenarios included loco-regional therapy with patient age varying at 
76 and 84 years; systemic therapy with Karnofsky performance score varying at 90 
and 50%; neo-adjuvant therapy; and adjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative BC.
RESULTS: Participants would less often recommend breast-conserving surgery plus 
radiotherapy for an 84 versus a 76-year-old patient (56% versus 73%, p = 0.001). 
They would more often accept omission of radiotherapy after breast-conserving 
surgery in older than in younger patients, if the patient wished to avoid this 
therapy (26% versus 4%, p < 0.001). All participants would propose systemic 
therapy for a high-recurrence risk patient with a good performance score, and 
92% would still recommend therapy if the patient had a poor score (p < 0.001). 
Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy followed by breast-conserving surgery for a large 
tumour was recommended by 27% of the participants. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an 
otherwise healthy woman with triple-negative BC was considered by 83% of the 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient age and performance status influenced specialists' 
treatment recommendations. The observed recommendations for the treatment 
scenarios under investigation differ from older women's actual treatment. This 
discrepancy highlights the need for studies specifically targeting older 
patients.

Breast cancer may affect young women who have not yet completed childbearing. 
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) provides alternatives for fertility 
preservation such as oocyte, embryo or ovarian tissue cryopreservation. We 
reviewed the published literature on fertility-preserving management in breast 
cancer, aiming at finding evidence to answer the following questions: (1) What 
are the fertility sparing options available?; (2) How do these women respond to 
IVF? and (3) Can pregnancy influence breast cancer recurrence? There is a 
paucity of publications describing clinical experience and outcome data which 
limits accessibility to fertility preservation in this setting. Presently, 
oocyte or embryo cryopreservation are the main options for fertility 
preservation. IVF success rates are comparable to the ones of non-oncological 
populations according to the woman's age but current published studies lack data 
on definitive success rates following embryo banking for cancer patients. The 
perception that IVF and pregnancy may worsen cancer prognosis remains, despite 
the lack of scientific evidence to support this notion. Published studies show 
reassuring results for pregnancies occurring >2 years after breast cancer 
diagnosis. The best published evidence suggests pregnancy after breast cancer 
does not increase the risk of disease recurrence, thus pregnancy should not be 
forbidden once treatment is completed. Decision making for women diagnosed with 
cancer requires up-to-date knowledge of the efficacy and safety of available 
options. Providing consultation with a reproductive specialist and appropriate 
information on fertility preservation for these women should be an essential 
aspect of their supportive care.

INTRODUCTION: The best local management for breast cancer recurrence following 
conservative treatment for breast cancer (BC) continues to be an open question. 
In this study, we compared patients' outcome after salvage lumpectomy (SL) vs 
mastectomy for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 2014 we identified 121 patients with 
pT0-2, N0-3, M0 BC who had BCT as their primary treatment, and subsequently had 
IBTR (unifocal). 47 patients underwent SL and 74 salvage mastectomy (SM) as the 
local treatment for their 1st recurrence.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 years (1-30) from first BC diagnosis. For the 
SL and SM cohorts, 8 and 10 patients (17%, 13.5%, P = 0.22), respectively, 
developed subsequent local recurrence as a 3rd event. Although in MVA, woman who 
underwent SL had higher chances of having a 2nd recurrence (3rd event), 
P = 0.020, at a median follow-up of 14 years, 95.8% of SL patients are alive, 
NED, 85% are mastectomy free. 87% of patients who opted for SM are alive, NED. 
Having re-irradiation following SL did not protect against 2nd breast cancer 
recurrence (3rd event, P = 0.42).
CONCLUSION: Salvage lumpectomy following IBTR, while associated with higher 
second LR rate than SM is not associated with inferior outcome. With survival 
>95% at 14 years in the SL cohort, salvage lumpectomy with or without 
re-radiation, in a selected population (unifocal T), represents an acceptable 
treatment option for patients in order to delay time to mastectomy without 
reducing BC survival. Both options should be discussed prior to any surgical 
decision.

As per global cancer statistics of 2020, female breast cancer is the most 
commonly diagnosed cancer and also the foremost cause of cancer death in women. 
Traditional treatments include a number of negative effects, making it necessary 
to investigate novel smart drug delivery methods and identify new therapeutic 
approaches. Efforts for developing novel strategies for breast cancer therapy 
are being devised worldwide by various research groups. Currently, 
two-dimensional black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) have attracted considerable 
attention and are best suited for theranostic nanomedicine. Particularly, their 
characteristics, including drug loading efficacy, biocompatibility, optical, 
thermal, electrical, and phototherapeutic characteristics, support their growing 
demand as a potential substitute for graphene-based nanomaterials in biomedical 
applications. In this review, we have explained different platforms of BP 
nanomaterials for breast cancer management, their structures, functionalization 
approaches, and general methods of synthesis. Various characteristics of BP 
nanomaterials that make them suitable for cancer therapy and diagnosis, such as 
large surface area, nontoxicity, solubility, biodegradability, and excellent 
near-infrared (NIR) absorption capability, are discussed in the later sections. 
Next, we summarize targeting approaches using various strategies for effective 
therapy with BP nanoplatforms. Then, we describe applications of BP 
nanomaterials for breast cancer treatment, which include drug delivery, 
codelivery of drugs, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, combined 
therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and multidrug resistance reversal 
strategy. Finally, the present challenges and future aspects of BP nanomaterials 
are discussed.

The need for targeted research into breast cancer in the elderly.

Wyld L(1), Reed MW.

Author information:
(1)Academic Surgical Oncology Unit, University of Sheffield, K Floor, Royal 
Hallamshire Hospital, Glossop Road, UK.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a major source of morbidity and mortality in 
elderly women. Despite this, many trials on which clinical practice is based 
have under-represented the elderly. Consequently there is little evidence to 
guide best practice in this age group.
METHODS: A search of the major literature databases was performed using the 
search terms 'breast cancer' and 'elderly'. Articles relevant to the treatment 
of breast cancer in the elderly were selected.
RESULTS: The elderly receive less aggressive treatment for breast cancer 
compared with younger patients. Primary endocrine therapy is sometimes 
substituted for operation, and axillary surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and 
adjuvant radiotherapy are commonly omitted. Evidence for and against such 
treatment strategies is inadequate, making it difficult to determine what 
constitutes best practice.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for research to be targeted at the older age group 
of patients with breast cancer to enable the development of specific treatment 
guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard treatment 
regimen for locally advanced breast cancer and has recently been incorporated 
into the treatment of early breast cancer. It allows down-staging of tumors 
favoring breast-conservative surgery over mastectomy. Furthermore, NAC results 
in nodal conversion in about 40% of patients. This favorable outcome has 
complicated the decision-making regarding the best approach in managing the 
axilla post-treatment; especially in pathologically proven nodal disease prior 
to NAC. Axillary lymph node clearance is still the standard-of-care for this 
group of patients; however, it is clearly an over-treatment in a substantial 
number of patients. Given the high accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) 
post-NAC in clinically node-negative cases prior to treatment, substantial 
research has been carried out in order to validate the feasibility of post-NAC 
SLNB in pathologically proven node-positive cases. The results so far are still 
inconclusive, yet promising.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a computer-aided review of the literature 
for relevant articles on the performance of SLNB post-NAC in pathologically 
proven node-positive patients prior to chemotherapy. We also targeted studies on 
important factors that can refine the accuracy of SLNB in this group of 
patients, as well as elements favoring pathological complete response. All 
studies focusing on post-NAC SLNB in pre-treatment node-positive cases including 
randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective series, review 
articles, and two meta-analyses were included.
RESULTS: The review established a false-negative rate of 14-15.1% and an IR of 
89-92.3%. Several technical enhancements, as well as imaging modalities, may be 
incorporated to improve the performance of SLNB. Furthermore, selected patients 
with more likelihood of pathological complete response represent the best 
candidates for this technique.
CONCLUSION: SLNB is a valid option after NAC in patients with pathologically 
proven node-positive breast cancer, given the high node-conversion rate. The 
literature demonstrated a false-negative rate that is slightly higher than that 
of patients initially node-negative which although might increase the 
locoregional recurrence in theory, has no effect on chemotherapy-decision 
making, and will most probably have no impact on overall survival. We identified 
several measures to refine its accuracy.

Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical workflows, 
with self-learning systems like ChatGPT showing promise in therapy 
recommendations. Our study evaluated ChatGPT's performance in suggesting 
treatments for 30 breast cancer cases. AI's role in healthcare is expanding, 
particularly with tools like ChatGPT becoming accessible. However, understanding 
its limitations is vital for safe implementation. Material and Methods: We used 
30 breast cancer cases from our medical board, assessing ChatGPT's suggestions. 
The input was standardized, incorporating relevant patient details and treatment 
options. ChatGPT's output was evaluated by oncologists based on a given 
questionnaire. Results: Treatment recommendations by ChatGPT were overall rated 
sufficient with minor limitations by the oncologists. The HER2 treatment 
category was the best-rated therapy option, with the most accurate 
recommendations. Primary cases received more accurate recommendations, 
especially regarding chemotherapy. Conclusions: While ChatGPT demonstrated 
potential, difficulties were shown in intricate cases and postoperative 
scenarios. Challenges arose in offering chronological treatment sequences and 
partially lacked precision. Refining inputs, addressing ethical intricacies, and 
ensuring chronological treatment suggestions are essential. Ongoing research is 
vital to improving AI's accuracy, balancing AI-driven suggestions with expert 
insights and ensuring safe and reliable AI integration into patient care.

Postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is a mainstay of local therapy for many 
breast cancer patients. Patients undergoing mastectomy typically are offered 
options for breast reconstruction. For patients who are candidates for PMRT, 
there are ongoing challenges with combining optimal radiation technique to 
prioritize oncologic outcomes, against the goals of minimizing toxicity and 
achieving the best reconstruction outcomes. The process by which these decisions 
are made continues to evolve as surgical and radiation techniques have improved 
and expanded, and as more patients with different risk profiles for local 
recurrence are receiving PMRT. We review the considerations regarding the 
different types of reconstruction and timing with radiation treatment. We also 
review the technical radiation consideration such as dose-fractionation, use of 
bolus and scar boost, exploring the controversies associated with the nuanced 
decisions regarding radiation and reconstructive surgery which are influenced by 
variables that are under continued investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To employ machine learning methods to predict the eventual 
therapeutic response of breast cancer patients after a single cycle of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and 
diffusion-weighted MRI data were acquired on 28 patients before and after one 
cycle of NAC. A total of 118 semiquantitative and quantitative parameters were 
derived from these data and combined with 11 clinical variables. We used 
Bayesian logistic regression in combination with feature selection using a 
machine learning framework for predictive model building.
RESULTS: The best predictive models using feature selection obtained an area 
under the curve of 0.86 and an accuracy of 0.86, with a sensitivity of 0.88 and 
a specificity of 0.82.
DISCUSSION: With the numerous options for NAC available, development of a method 
to predict response early in the course of therapy is needed. Unfortunately, by 
the time most patients are found not to be responding, their disease may no 
longer be surgically resectable, and this situation could be avoided by the 
development of techniques to assess response earlier in the treatment regimen. 
The method outlined here is one possible solution to this important clinical 
problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Predictive modeling approaches based on machine learning using 
readily available clinical and quantitative MRI data show promise in 
distinguishing breast cancer responders from non-responders after the first 
cycle of NAC.
