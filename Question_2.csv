Abstract
"Real-world data are limited for patients with brain metastases secondary to metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i). This study describes real-world outcomes in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) MBC with brain metastases diagnosis before abemaciclib initiation. A nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified MBC database (January 2011-December 2021) was assessed retrospectively. Patients with HR+/HER2- MBC who were treated with abemaciclib (monotherapy or in combination) following diagnosis of brain metastases were included. Real-world best response reflected clinician-documented response assessment of the brain imaging (intracranial) and change in disease burden following radiographic imaging (extracranial); these were reported descriptively. Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD), real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS), and overall survival (rwOS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods from abemaciclib initiation (index date). Among 82 included patients (mean age 57.0 years; 98.8% female), 22.0% and 19.5% received CDK4/6i and chemotherapy before abemaciclib initiation, respectively, and the majority (80.5%) received radiation/local surgery to the brain before abemaciclib initiation. Patients mostly received abemaciclib as monotherapy (n = 6) or in combination with endocrine therapy (n = 68). Median TTD was 7.1 (95% CI 4.6-11.3) months, rwPFS was 9.2 (95% CI 6.0-11.6) months, and rwOS was 20.8 (95% CI 13.9-26.0) months. Intracranial and extracranial objective response rates, as determined by treating physicians, were 45.1% (n = 23/51) and 56.7% (n = 34/60), respectively. Intracranial and extracranial clinical benefit rates were 62.7% (n = 32/51) and 70.0% (n = 42/60), respectively. In this real-world study of patients diagnosed with brain metastases and initiating abemaciclib, most patients received radiation/local surgery to the brain before abemaciclib initiation. Although the outcomes in this real-world study are encouraging, it is unclear if the benefit was due to local therapy, abemaciclib, or the combination, and causality cannot be inferred. Further prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm the clinical benefit of this approach. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press."
"Risk management and self-management strategies for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) must balance best-evidence guidelines and associated risk factor knowledge. There is an evidence-based practice gap in the understanding of whether a change in education about risk factors and whether behavioral changes actually influence BCRL manifestation or progression. The purpose of this study was to (1) review if current evidence supports or refutes patient precautions to prevent the manifestation and/or progression of BCRL, (2) review if behavioral changes result in the prevention or reduction of BCRL, and (3) identify related gaps of knowledge for future research. Evidence map methodology was used to systematically review literature related to reducing the risk of BCRL. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane for the categories of trauma, blood pressure, temperature, air travel, and behavior change. One hundred and forty-eight articles were included for full-text review, of which 37 articles were included in this study. Within the confines of limb and trunk circumferential and/or volume enlargement, a 'just in case' approach to patient education on risk factors may not be appropriate for breast cancer survivors at risk of manifesting lymphedema. Patient education about precautionary risks for the onset of BCRL needs to align with research evidence. There is scant evidence about the risks of BCRL progression suggesting a need for future research. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to be the most common complication after distal pancreatectomy (DP). Recent advancements in surgical techniques have established minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) as the standard treatment for various conditions, including pancreatic cancer. However, MIDP has not demonstrated a clear advantage over open DP in terms of POPF rates, indicating the need for additional strategies to prevent POPF in MIDP. This trial (WRAP study) aims to evaluate the efficacy of wrapping the pancreatic stump with polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue in preventing clinically relevant (CR-) POPF following MIDP. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial will include patients scheduled for laparoscopic or robotic DP for tumors in the pancreatic body and/or tail. Eligible participants will be centrally randomized into either the control group (Group A) or the intervention group (Group B), where the pancreatic stump will be reinforced by PGA mesh and fibrin glue. In both groups, pancreatic transection will be performed using a bioabsorbable reinforcement-attached stapler. A total of 172 patients will be enrolled across 14 high-volume centers in Japan. The primary endpoint is the incidence of CR-POPF (International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery grade B/C). The WRAP study will determine whether the reinforcement of the pancreatic stump with PGA mesh and fibrin glue, a technique whose utility has been previously debated, could become the best practice in the era of MIDP, thereby enhancing its safety. This trial was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials on June 15, 2024 (jRCTs032240120). © 2024. The Author(s)."
"We aim to develop a predictive model for lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in patients with invasive breast cancer (IBC), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics features. A total of 204 patients with IBC admitted to our hospital were included in this retrospective study. The data was split into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Feature normalization was conducted, followed by feature selection using ANOVA, correlation analysis, and LASSO in the training set. The final step involved building a logistic regression model. The LVI prediction models were established by single sequence image and combined different sequence images as follows: A: prediction model based on the optimal sequence in the 7-phase enhanced MRI scans; B: prediction model based on the optimal sequences in the sequences T1WI, T2WI, and DWI; and C: the combined model based on the optimal sequences selected from A and B. Subjects' work characteristic curves (ROC) and decision curves (DCA) were plotted to determine the extent to which they predicted LVI performance in the training and validation sets. Simultaneously, nomogram models were constructed by integrating radiomics features and independent risk factors. In addition, an additional 16 patients from the center between January and August 2024 were collected as the Nomogram external validation set. The ROC and DCA were used to evaluate the performance of the model. In the enhanced images, Model A built based on the enhanced 2-phase achieved the best average AUC, with a validation set of 0.764. Model B built based on the T2WI had better results, with a validation set of 0.693. Model C built by combining enhanced 2-phase and T2WI sequences had a mean AUC of 0.705 in the validation set. In addition, the tumor size, whether the tumor boundary was clear or not, and whether there was a coelom in the tumor tissue had a statistically significant effect on the LVI of IBC, and a clinical-radiomics nomogram was established. DCAs as well as Nomogram also indicate that Model A has good clinical utility. The AUC of the nomogram in the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set were 0.703, 0.615, and 0.609, respectively. The DCA also showed that the radiomics nomogram combined with clinical factors had good predictive ability for LVI. In IBC, MRI radiomics can serve as a noninvasive predictor of LVI. The clinical-MRI radiomics model, as an efficient visual prognostic tool, shows promise in forecasting LVI. This highlights the significant potential of pre-radiomics prediction in enhancing treatment strategies. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women worldwide, having a significant impact on women's well-being. Early diagnosis of breast cancer followed by appropriate treatment is considered the best survival factor. Microneedles (MN) have been utilized for non-invasive localized breast cancer treatment. The combination of nano-carriers with MN technology represents an appealing strategy for improving drug delivery efficacy. It is worth noting that atorvastatin (ATV) has received substantial interest as a drug with potential anticancer activity. Our study aimed to formulate an ATV-loaded bioactive pumpkin seed oil vesicular nanocarrier; pumpkisomes (PUMP) for enhanced localized delivery to breast cancer using MN. The selected PUMP formulation had a particle size of 151.8 ± 2.7 nm, zeta potential of -54.1 mV, and % entrapment efficiency of 73 %. PUMP showed a sustained ATV release, potent selective cytotoxic effect (IC 50 Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier B.V."

"In resource-limited settings, data regarding the impact of molecular/receptor subtypes on breast cancer (BC) are sparse. In this single-center retrospective study from north India, we analyze the outcomes of various molecular subtypes of BC. Females with biopsy-proven BC who were treated at our State Cancer Institute from 2014-2018 were included. Data regarding clinicopathological parameters and follow-up details were evaluated. For data analysis, cancers were categorized into 4 subtypes: HR+HER2-, HR+HER2+, HR-HER2+, and HR-HER2-. Among 944 patients included, HR+HER2- (49.1%) and HR+HER2+ (13.1%) were the most and least common subtypes, respectively. The receptor subtype significantly impacted overall survival (OS). HR+HER2- cancers had the best outcomes while HR-HER2- cancers fared worst (3-yr OS of 94.3% and 69.1%, respectively). On subgroup analysis, the molecular subtype continued to significantly impact OS in patients with tumor grades II and III, disease stages II and III, and age groups of <40 and 40-60 years, respectively (HR-HER2- cancers had the lowest cumulative survival in each subgroup). In patients with metastatic BC, all molecular subtypes except HR+HER2- had a dismal prognosis. Overall and across various subgroups, patients with triple-negative BC had the poorest outcomes. Ensuring optimal treatment utilization including affordable access to personalized tailored therapy is the need of the hour to improve long-term outcomes in these patients.

"Chemotherapy in an integral part of cancer treatment, either administered alone or in combination with radiation. However, the cost of these drugs is often prohibitively high for most patients. To address this issue, the Government of India has established Jan Aushadhi (JAS) stores across the country, where affordable generic medicines are available. In the current study, we performed a cost minimization analysis comparing JAS drugs with branded chemotherapeutic drugs used in various cancer treatment regimens. This study was to conduct a cost-minimization analysis by comparing the costs of different regimens when using JAS drugs, the most expensive branded drugs, and the least expensive branded drugs in the treatment of cancer in India. The study focused on conducting a cost minimization analysis of various chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of different cancers, considering the availability of anticancer drugs at JAS stores. The costs for different chemotherapy regimens, including both anticancer and supportive drugs, were calculated for single and complete cycles. The costs of the most expensive and least expensive branded drugs were noted from the Current Index of Medical Stores. The cost difference (CD) was calculated by subtracting the cost of the cheaper drug from that of the costliest brand. The cost ratio (CR) and the percentage of cost variation (PCV) were calculated for India-specific conditions. The study analyzed the CD for various regimens using JAS drugs for chemotherapy treatment of breast, esophagus, rectal, colon, stomach, prostate, ovary, endometrial, cervical, head and neck, lung, multiple myeloma, testicular, and lymphoma cancers. It also considered chemoirradiation regimens for brain, head and neck, anorectal, esophageal, and uterine cervical cancers. Significant CDs were observed when both anticancer and supportive drugs were obtained from JAS stores. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to consider the CD, CR, and PCV for various regimens using JAS drugs, as well as the costliest and cheapest branded drugs in standard cancer treatment regimens. The results of this study are expected to assist healthcare professionals and pharmacists in understanding the cost-saving benefits of substituting expensive branded drugs with more affordable chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer. This substitution can provide financial benefit for socioeconomically marginalized population. Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics."
"STK11 germline pathogenic variants are typically associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, hyperpigmented patches, and increased risk of stomach, colorectal, small bowel, and breast cancers (Beggs et al., 2010). Mutations in this gene have also been identified in skin, pancreatic, testicular, and stromal ovarian cancer (Fagerberg et al., 2014). To date, there have been less than 30 cases of ovarian cancer reported associated with mutated STK11 (Bennett et al., 2021). In this report, we discuss a rare case of a STK11 adnexal tumor in a 39-year-old woman previously diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. After 33 months with no evidence of disease following cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC and adjuvant chemotherapy, a new retroperitoneal lesion was noted on imaging. After resection, molecular testing indicated an STK11 mutation, and histology was consistent with an STK11 adnexal tumor. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis of STK11 adnexal tumor due to its non-distinct pathology and IHC staining. Due to the rarity of this neoplasm, analysis of current and future cases of the STK11 adnexal tumor is necessary to understand its pathogenesis, genetic mutational analysis, clinical course, and best treatment options. © 2024 The Author(s)."

Introduction Methods Results Conclusions
"The presented study depicts the synthesis of 11 carborane-thiazole conjugates with anticancer activity, as well as an evaluation of their biological activity as inhibitors of two enzymes: tyrosinase and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1). The overexpression of tyrosinase results in the intracellular accumulation of melanin and can be observed in melanoma. The overexpression of 11β-HSD1 results in an elevation of glucocorticoid levels and has been associated with the aggravation of metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recently, as the comorbidity of melanomas and metabolic disorders is being recognized as an important issue, the search for new therapeutic options has intensified. This study demonstrates that carborane-thiazole derivatives inhibit both enzymes, exerting beneficial effects. The antiproliferative action of all newly synthesized compounds was evaluated using three cancer cell lines, namely A172 (human brain glioblastoma), B16F10 (murine melanoma) and MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma), as well as a healthy control cell line of HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). The results show that 9 out of 11 newly synthesized compounds demonstrated similar antiproliferative action against the B16F10 cell line to the reference drug, and three of these compounds surpassed it. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate dual inhibitory action of carborane-thiazole derivatives against both tyrosinase and 11β-HSD1. Therefore, it represents the first step towards the simultaneous treatment of melanoma and comorbid diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus."
"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. One of the best therapeutic methods against breast cancer is gene therapy, while having an appropriate gene carrier is the biggest challenge of gene therapy. Hence, developing carriers with low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency, and preferentially with the selective function of gene delivery is a critical demand for this method. In the present study, we introduce a novel targeted carrier to deliver the inducible caspase-9 suicide gene (pLVSIN-iC9) into breast cancer cells. The carrier is composed of graphene oxide quantum dots decorated with polyethyleneimine, and S2.2; an aptamer with high affinity to MUC1 (GOQD-PEI/S2.2). Due to the overexpression of MUC1 in breast cancer cells, the designed GOQD-PEI/S2.2/pLVSIN-iC9 can selectively target cancer cells. Moreover, to better mimic solid tumor conditions, and to evaluate the selective effect of the GOQD-PEI/S2.2/pLVSIN-iC9, an organoid model derived from human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and MCF-7 cells (coculture organoid) was generated and characterized. The results demonstrate that the coculture organoid model adapts the tissue structure of luminal breast cancer, as well. Therefore, the organoids were subjected to treatment with targeted gene therapy using GOQD-PEI/S2.2/pLVSIN-iC9. Our evidence supports the targeted killing effect of iC9 on the breast cancer cells of the organoids and suggests the good potential of the newly introduced carriers in targeted gene delivery. © 2024.

"Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer in women, recognized as one of the most dangerous types of cancer, and is on the rise globally. Regular screenings are essential for early-stage treatment. Digital mammography (DM) is the most recognized and widely used technique for breast cancer screening. Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM or CM) is used in conjunction with DM to detect and identify hidden abnormalities, particularly in dense breast tissue where DM alone might not be as effective. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of each modality (CM, DM, or both) in detecting breast cancer lesions using deep learning methods. We introduce an architecture for detecting and classifying breast cancer lesions in DM and CM images in Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral Oblique (MLO) views. The proposed architecture (JointNet) consists of a convolution module for extracting local features, a transformer module for extracting long-range features, and a feature fusion layer to fuse the local features, global features, and global features weighted based on the local ones. This significantly enhances the accuracy of classifying DM and CM images into normal or abnormal categories and lesion classification into benign or malignant. Using our architecture as a backbone, three lesion classification pipelines are introduced that utilize attention mechanisms focused on lesion shape, texture, and overall breast texture, examining the critical features for effective lesion classification. The results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform their components in classifying images as normal or abnormal and mitigate the limitations of independently using the transformer module or the convolution module. An ensemble model is also introduced to explore the effect of each modality and each view to increase our baseline architecture's accuracy. The results demonstrate superior performance compared with other similar works. The best performance on DM images was achieved with the semi-automatic AOL Lesion Classification Pipeline, yielding an accuracy of 98.85 %, AUROC of 0.9965, F1-score of 98.85 %, precision of 98.85 %, and specificity of 98.85 %. For CM images, the highest results were obtained using the automatic AOL Lesion Classification Pipeline, with an accuracy of 97.47 %, AUROC of 0.9771, F1-score of 97.34 %, precision of 94.45 %, and specificity of 97.23 %. The semi-automatic ensemble AOL Classification Pipeline provided the best overall performance when using both DM and CM images, with an accuracy of 94.74 %, F1-score of 97.67 %, specificity of 93.75 %, and sensitivity of 95.45 %. Furthermore, we explore the comparative effectiveness of CM and DM images in deep learning models, indicating that while CM images offer clearer insights to the human eye, our model trained on DM images yields better results using Attention on Lesion (AOL) techniques. The research also suggests a multimodal approach using both DM and CM images and ensemble learning could provide more robust classification outcomes. Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"As the spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners improves, understanding of radiotracer distributions in tissues at high resolutions is important. Hence, we propose a method for co-registration of high-resolution ex vivo specimen PET images, combined with computed tomography (CT) images, and the corresponding specimen histopathology. We applied our co-registration method to breast cancer (BCa) specimens of patients who were preoperatively injected with 0.8 MBq/kg [  18 18 We imaged 22 BCa specimens, 13 cases of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), 6 of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and 3 of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). While the cassette framework minimised tissue deformation, the best alignment between the micro-PET-CT images and WSIs was achieved after deformable co-registration. We found an overall average co-registration error of 0.74 ± 0.17 mm between the micro-PET images and WSIs. (Pre)malignant tissue (including NST, ILC, and DCIS) generally showed higher SUVs than healthy tissue (including healthy glandular, connective, and adipose tissue). As expected, inflamed tissue and skin also showed high uptake. We developed a method to co-register micro-PET-CT images of surgical specimens and WSIs with an accuracy comparable to the spatial resolution of the micro-PET images. While currently, we only applied this method to BCa specimens, we believe this method is applicable to a wide range of specimens and radiotracers, providing insight into distributions of (new) radiotracers in human malignancies at a sub-millimetre resolution. © 2024.

"We aimed to investigate the impact of social circumstances on cancer therapy selection using natural language processing to derive insights from social worker documentation. We developed and employed a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based approach, using a hierarchical multi-step BERT model (BERT-MS), to predict the prescription of targeted cancer therapy to patients based solely on documentation by clinical social workers. Our corpus included free-text clinical social work notes, combined with medication prescription information, for all patients treated for breast cancer at UCSF between 2012 and 2021. We conducted a feature importance analysis to identify the specific social circumstances that impact cancer therapy regimen. Using only social work notes, we consistently predicted the administration of targeted therapies, suggesting systematic differences in treatment selection exist due to non-clinical factors. The findings were confirmed by several language models, with GatorTron achieving the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.721 and a Macro F1 score of 0.616. The UCSF BERT-MS model, capable of leveraging multiple pieces of notes, surpassed the UCSF-BERT model in both AUROC and Macro-F1. Our feature importance analysis identified several clinically intuitive social determinants of health that potentially contribute to disparities in treatment. Leveraging social work notes can be instrumental in identifying disparities in clinical decision-making. Hypotheses generated in an automated way could be used to guide patient-specific quality improvement interventions. Further validation with diverse clinical outcomes and prospective studies is essential. Our findings indicate that significant disparities exist among breast cancer patients receiving different types of therapies based on social determinants of health. Social work reports play a crucial role in understanding these disparities in clinical decision-making. © The Author(s) 2024.

"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently occurring cancer disease observed in women after lung cancer. Out of different stages, invasive ductal BC causes maximum deaths in women. In this work, three deep learning (DL) models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Convmixer, and Visual Geometry Group-19 (VGG-19) are implemented for the detection and classification of different breast cancer tumors with the help of Breast cancer histopathological (Break His) image database. The performance of each model is evaluated using an 80:20 training scheme and measured in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, loss, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). From the simulation result, ViT showed the best performance for binary classification of breast cancer tumors with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 99.89 %, 98.29 %, 98.29 %, and 98.29 %, respectively. Also, ViT showed the best performance in terms of accuracy (98.21 %), average Precision (89.84 %), recall (89.97 %), and F1-score (88.75) for eight class classifications. Moreover, we have also ensemble the ViT-Convmixer model and observed that the performance of the ensemble model is reduced as compared to the ViT model. We have also compared the performance of the proposed best model with other existing models reported by several research groups. The study will help find suitable models that will increase accuracy in early diagnoses of BC. We hope the study will also help to minimize human errors in the early diagnosis of this fatal disease and administer appropriate treatment. The proposed model may also be implemented for the detection of other diseases with improved accuracy. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Breast Cancer (BC) poses significant challenges in treatment decision-making. Multiple first treatment lines are currently available, determined by several patient-specific factors that need to be considered in the decision-making process. To present CureMate, a Clinical Decision Support System to predict the most effective initial treatment for BC patients. Different artificial intelligence models based on demographic, anatomopathological and magnetic resonance imaging variables are studied. CureMate's web application allows for easy use of the best model. A database of 232 BCE patients, each described by 29 variables, was established. Out of four machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the most suitable model for the task was identified, optimized and independently tested. SVM was identified as the best model for BC treatment planning, resulting in a test accuracy of 0.933. CureMate's web application, including the SVM model, allows for introducing the relevant patient variables and displays the suggested first treatment step, as well as a diagram of the following steps. The results demonstrate CureMate's high accuracy and effectiveness in clinical settings, indicating its potential to aid practitioners in making informed therapeutic decisions.

"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, constituting 15% of cases in 2023. The predominant cause of breast cancer-related mortality is metastasis, and a lack of metastasis-targeted therapies perpetuates dismal outcomes for late-stage patients. By using meiotic genetics to study inherited transcriptional network regulation, we have identified, to the best of our knowledge, a new class of ""essential expression-restricted"" genes as potential candidates for metastasis-targeted therapeutics. Building upon previous work implicating the CCR4-NOT RNA deadenylase complex in metastasis, we demonstrate that RNA-binding proteins NANOS1, PUM2, and CPSF4 also regulate metastatic potential. Using various models and clinical data, we pinpoint Smarcd1 mRNA as a target of all three RNA-BPs. Strikingly, both high and low expression of Smarcd1 correlate with positive clinical outcomes, while intermediate expression significantly reduces the probability of survival. Applying the theory of ""essential genes"" from evolution, we identify 50 additional genes that require precise expression levels for metastasis to occur. Specifically, small perturbations in Smarcd1 expression significantly reduce metastasis in mouse models and alter splicing programs relevant to the ER+/HER2-enriched breast cancer. Identification subtype-specific essential expression-restricted metastasis modifiers introduces a novel class of genes that, when therapeutically ""nudged"" in either direction, may significantly improve late-stage breast cancer patients. © 2024.

"Approximately 10 to 15% of patients with breast cancer will have a local recurrence after initial conservative treatment or mastectomy. Total mastectomy has historically been the standard treatment for local recurrence. However, the question of reirradiation may arise as part of a second conservative treatment in conjunction with segmentectomy or in the case of chest wall recurrence to improve local control. Different modalities are available: brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy with or without hyperthermia. Although the carcinologic results are encouraging, this complex situation requires rigorous patient selection and technical requirements to achieve the best local control and limit toxicity events. This article presents a review of the literature on the different indications and techniques for reirradiation of ipsilateral recurrent breast cancer, with the aim of providing decision support in clinical practice.

"One of the main regulators in the cell cycle is cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). FDA has approved CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, the development of selective agents remains problematic due to the conservation of their ATP binding sites. In the previous in silico study, ZINC585292724, ZINC585292587, ZINC585291674, and ZINC585291474 have been identified as potential inhibitors. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the selectivity and inhibitory activity of the four compounds against CDK4/6 in vitro as well as determine the potential for their further development in silico. The in vitro results showed that the four compounds had good selectivity towards both kinases, due to their similar structure. In agreement with the in silico results, ZINC585291674 produced the best inhibitory activity against CDK4 and CDK6, with IC50 of 184.14 nM and 111.78 nM, respectively. Their ADMET profile were also similar to reference compound of Palbociclib. Based on this, ZINC585291674 can be used as a lead compound for further inhibitor development. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"A century ago, the first description of secondary lymphedema resulting from mastectomy was published in the medical literature. For most of the remaining twentieth century, evidence about cancer treatment related lymphedema grew slowly, and mostly through clinicians who wished to understand its causes, natural-history, and post-treatment risks, as well as from clinicians involved with its treatment. In the late 1990s, there was growing recognition that there were large gaps in our understanding of predisposing and post-treatment risks of onset, the near and long-term prevalence of lymphedema, and how to educate patients. Moreover, there was no consensus on best practices for treating lymphedema, and how to ensure the quality of treatment. In 1998, with support from the Longaberger Company®, the American Cancer Society began a long-standing commitment to address enduring challenges associated with lymphedema. This commitment began with a landmark international workshop on lymphedema that was held in New York City in February 1998, millions of dollars in research funding, support to establish the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA), a second workshop convened in February 2011 on the prospective surveillance model for rehabilitation for women with breast cancer, and most recently, the 2023 Lymphedema Summit: Forward momentum; Future Steps in Lymphedema Management, co-sponsored with the LANA, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and the Stryker Corporation.

"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a life-threatening viral infection with no approved antiviral treatment. To determine whether restoring the compromised immune system of patients with PML with directly isolated allogeneic virus-specific (DIAVIS) T cells is a promising therapeutic strategy, especially if other curative options are absent. A retrospective case series of patients with PML who were treated with DIAVIS T cells was conducted between March 2020 and February 2022. T cells were isolated from healthy donors within 24 hours and targeted against the BK polyomavirus. Patients with PML were treated monocentrically. Eligibility for treatment with DIAVIS T cells was assessed for patients with confirmed PML, and exclusion criteria included stable PML disease and previous treatment with natalizumab. Fresh DIAVIS T cells were administered with a maximum dose of 2 × 104 CD3+ cells/kg body weight. Remaining T cells were cryopreserved in divided doses and administered in additional treatments approximately 2 and 6 weeks later. Primary outcome measures were clinical response and survival of patients, compared with the outcomes of a historical reference group of PML cases receiving best supportive treatment (BST) and with recently published real-world data of patients with PML who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibition. The study cohort consisted of 28 patients (median [IQR] age, 60 [51-72] years; 20 male [71.4%]). Twenty-two patients (79%) treated with DIAVIS T cells showed response, resulting in significant clinical stabilization or improvement and a reduction in viral load. Six individuals (21%) were classified as nonresponders, deteriorated rapidly, and died, as did 2 other patients during a 12-month follow-up. Older age was the only predictor of a poor treatment response. Survival analysis revealed better 12-month survival rates (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.73; P =.02) from diagnosis for patients treated with DIAVIS T cells (18 of 26 [69%]; 12-mo survival rate, 69%) compared with historical controls with BST (57 of 113 [50%]; 12-mo survival rate, including censored data, 45%). This case series of DIAVIS T-cell therapy in PML provides first class IV evidence suggesting efficacy to reduce mortality and improve functional outcome. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these results."
"A high abundance of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in malignant cells makes them a prospective therapeutic target for basal breast tumors. Although EGFR inhibitors are in development as anticancer therapeutics, there exists limitations due to the dose-limiting cytotoxicity that limits their clinical utilization, thereby necessitating the advancement of effective inhibitors. In the present study, we have developed common pharmacophore hypotheses using 30 known EGFR inhibitors.

"In patients vulnerable to skeletal-related events (SREs), a multidisciplinary approach is required to manage risk and determine the best treatment plan. We have used Bone Metastasis Cancer Boards (BMCBs) to deliver multidisciplinary treatments in our hospital since 2013. Here, we report a case in which we used BMCBs to coordinate multidisciplinary treatment for a pregnant patient with breast cancer and multiple bone metastases. A 41-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to our hospital because low back pain compromised her ability to stand. She was diagnosed with breast cancer-associated multiple bone metastases. Our unit was consulted for rehabilitation therapy, for which we formed a BMCB. The treatment was integrated and performed according to the recommendations of the BMCB. The patient underwent a cesarean section to initiate primary tumor treatment. After evaluating the risk of SREs, we provided her with rehabilitation therapy. Wearing a plastic molded thoracolumbosacral orthosis, she was able to walk with a pick-up walker. The patient continued outpatient chemotherapy and cared for her infant without experiencing any significant adverse events. In this case, we formed our BMCB to determine the treatment plan, which we used to support the patient's needs during childbirth and successfully improved her activities of daily living. BMCBs can contribute to preventing SREs and provide effective rehabilitation therapy for patients with bone metastases. We aspire to continually gather experience through our BMCBs and contribute to the establishment of evidence regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy for patients with bone metastases. 2024 The Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine."
"Arytenoid dislocation, typically manifested as hoarseness and coughing when drinking, is a rare perioperative scenario, with an incidence rate of 0.009 %-0.097 % and endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia being the most common cause. However, arytenoid dislocation caused by a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is extremely rare. Herein, a 53-year-old female patient was admitted for a ""right breast lump"" and scheduled for ""unilateral mastectomy with ipsilateral axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy"" under general anesthesia. During the surgery, the patient was noted to snore mildly, and rocuronium (15 mg) was immediately administered intravenously. The snoring ceased after adjusting the position of the LMA. Postoperatively, the patient was diagnosed with arytenoid dislocation by flexible nasal endoscopy after presenting with a sore throat accompanied by hoarseness and coughing when drinking. Thereafter, the patient underwent two cricoarytenoid joint reductions with a video laryngoscope under intravenous anesthesia, along with anti-inflammatory medication and voice therapy. The voice of the patient returned to normal after 1 month. Despite being a supraglottic airway device, the LMA can still cause arytenoid dislocation in clinical practice. Hence, anesthesiologists should analyze the potential causes and understand the diagnosis and treatment of arytenoid dislocation. Although closed reduction surgery typically requires two or three attempts, with a shorter disease duration leading to better outcomes, it can also aid in voice recovery for a longer disease course. In the presented case, the patient achieved a good prognosis after two closed reduction surgeries. Anesthesiologists should be vigilant for arytenoid dislocation in patients who present with persistent hoarseness and coughing while drinking after the insertion of the LMA, necessitating prompt treatment after diagnoses to achieve the best results.

"Radiotherapy (RT) serves as one of the key adjuvant treatments in management of breast cancer. Nevertheless, RT has two major problems: side effects and radioresistance. Given that patients respond differently to RT, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. Two-thirds of human genes do not encode proteins, as we have realized from genome-scale studies conducted after the advent of the genomic era; nevertheless, molecular understanding of breast cancer to date has been attained almost entirely based on protein-coding genes and their pathways. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a poorly understood but abundant class of human genes that yield functional non-protein-coding RNA transcripts. Here, we canvass the field to seek evidence for the hypothesis that lncRNAs contribute to radioresistance in breast cancer. RT-responsive lncRNAs ranging from ""classical"" lncRNAs discovered at the dawn of the post-genomic era (such as HOTAIR, NEAT1, and CCAT), to long intergenic lncRNAs such as LINC00511 and LINC02582, antisense lncRNAs such as AFAP-AS1 and FGD5-AS1, and pseudogene transcripts such as DUXAP8 were found during our screen of the literature. Radiation-related pathways modulated by these lncRNAs include DNA damage repair, cell cycle, cancer stem cells phenotype and apoptosis. Thus, providing a clear picture of these lncRNAs' underlying RT-relevant molecular mechanisms should help improve overall survival and optimize the best radiation dose for each individual patient. Moreover, in healthy humans, lncRNAs show greater natural expression variation than protein-coding genes, even across individuals, alluding to their exceptional potential for targeting in truly personalized, precision medicine.

"Breast cancer is one of the main Cancers affecting patients all over the world; however, till now, there has been no successful treatment without any side effects on patient health, but there are groups of medications similar to MDM2 inhibitors that have promising effects. The aim of this study was to find out whether the use of mdm2 inhibitors can help treat breast cancer using three cell lines. The use of treatments belonging to the MDM2 inhibitor alone or with the use of doxorubicin together with a combination of Nutlin-3, Miladometan, Yh239-EE, and doxorubicin in breast cancer cell lines HP100, MCF7. Cell lines were treated with different concentrations of MDM2 inhibitors 1,5,10, and 20 micromolar alone or in combinations with doxorubicin. After that, cell viability was estimated by the MTT assay method. Then, we have assessed the expression of caspase as an indicator of cell apoptosis after treatment, and the expression of P53 and MDM2 after and before treatment. The IC50 of Doxorubicin in the MCf7 cell line was about 1.12 µM. The best IC50% in MDM2 inhibitors was for Nutlin, about 5.9 µM, then for Yh239-EE about 8.45 µM, and Milademetan about 11.07 µM the high IC50% values in normal epithelial cell HBl100. Also, the MDM2 inhibitor increased P53 levels, as did doxorubicin. Our research concluded that Nutlin 3 has a superior effect over Yh239-EE and Miladometan in treating Breast cancer; moreover, the combination group has shown to be more effective than treatment with Doxorubicin or MDM2 inhibitors alone. Interesting information is that Doxorubicin also causes an increase in P53 levels. This result provided us with a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. However, more research is required to be conducted on more types of cell lines and in human or animal models (Tab. 4, Fig. 8, Ref. 33).

"Loop ileostomy is commonly performed by colorectal and general surgeons to protect newly created large bowel anastomoses. The optimal timing for ileostomy closure remains debatable. Defining the timing associated with the best postoperative outcomes can significantly improve the clinical results for patients undergoing ileostomy closure. The LILEO study was a prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in Poland from October 2022 to December 2023. Full data analysis involved 159 patients from 19 surgical centers. Patients were categorized based on the timing of ileostomy reversal: early (<4 months), standard (4-6 months), and delayed (>6 months). Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed for each group separately and compared.

"There are limited real-world data (RWD) regarding the use of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors in western Balkan. The aim of our study was thus to analyze factors influencing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), along with the differences in adverse effects of CDK 4/6 therapy in a tertiary healthcare center in Croatia. We evaluated medical and demographic data for 163 consecutive patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors for at least one month, from October 2018, after the drug became available in Croatia. Eligible patients in our study were those patients who were treated with palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib. The median PFS of CDK4/6 inhibitors treatment was 2.2 years (95% CI 1.8-3.3), with the longest ongoing treatment for 5.4 years. Treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in the first line was associated with a longer PFS compared to the second line or beyond (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), and patients without liver metastasis exhibited longer survival compared to patients with liver metastasis (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) (both  p p p p p p p p p p Our study provides the RWD with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

"Prophylactic dissection of paratracheal lymph nodes in clinically lymph node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains controversial. This study aims to integrate preoperative and intraoperative variables to compare traditional nomograms and machine learning (ML) models, developing and validating an interpretable predictive model for paratracheal lymph node metastasis (PLNM) in cN0 PTC patients. We retrospectively selected 3213 PTC patients treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2016 to 2020. They were randomly divided into the training and test datasets with a 7:3 ratio. The 533 PTC patients treated at the Guangyuan Central Hospital from 2019 to 2022 were used as an external test sets. We developed and validated nine ML models using 10-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, and precision-recall curves. The best model was compared to a traditional logistic regression-based nomogram. The XGBoost model achieved AUC values of 0.935, 0.857, and 0.775 in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, significantly outperforming the traditional nomogram model with AUCs of 0.85, 0.844, and 0.769, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based visualization identified the top 10 predictive features of the XGBoost model, and a web-based calculator was created based on these features. ML is a reliable tool for predicting PLNM in cN0 PTC patients. The SHAP method provides valuable insights into the XGBoost model, and the resultant web-based calculator is a clinically useful tool to assist in the surgical planning for paratracheal lymph node dissection. © 2024.

"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four techniques of partial breast irradiation (PBI) including interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT), balloon-based brachytherapy (BBT), Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) in the treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery. A systematic search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria were clinical trials and observational studies that reported on outcome measures of principal PBI techniques. The methodological quality of the included research data was assessed using bias risk assessment tool with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS), and the research information were analyzed using data analysis software. Clinical studies were collected from the earliest available date until September 2023. Fifty-one studies were included, with a total sample size of 7708. The results of network meta-analysis (NMA) showed that ISBT can lower the local recurrence (SUCRA: 73.8%). In terms of reducing distant metastasis, 3DCRT may be the best choice (SUCRA: 52.5%). And IORT has the highest 5-year overall survival (SUCRA: 90%). Furthermore, ISBT also has the advantages of lowest risk with fat necrosis (SUCRA: 72.5%), infection (SUCRA: 78.3%) and breast pain (SUCRA: 86.2%). BBT may be the optimal solution for fibrosis (SUCRA: 76.9%) and hyperpigmentation (SUCRA: 66.7%). 3DCRT has lower incidence of telangiectasia (SUCRA: 56.7%) and better cosmetic result (SUCRA: 85%). Postoperative PBI treatment using ISBT after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early-stage breast cancer may be a more valuable choice based on the treatment efficacy and is associated with fewer late side-effects. Large-scale, prospective, long-term studies are warranted to clarify the role of different PBI techniques in selected patients. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Cancer is a complex pathological condition associated with substantial rates of mortality and morbidity in both humans and animals. Mammary gland tumors in intact female dogs are the most prevalent neoplasms. Surgical intervention remains the primary treatment choice. Alternative therapeutic options have emerged, with histopathological examination being fundamental to confirm the diagnosis and to decide the best therapy. This research focused on the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic aspects of canine mammary tumors (CMTs). Most of the animals were mixed-breed, with the majority being older than seven years, and only 16.7% had been spayed before surgery. Caudal abdominal and inguinal mammary glands were the most affected, with regional mastectomy being the predominant treatment (75.0%). Of all the tumors, 29.1% were benign, while 70.9% were malignant. Complex adenoma was the most common benign tumor, whereas tubulopapillary carcinoma was the most common malignant type. Grade III tumors (17.6%) were the least encountered, while grades I and II exhibited a similar prevalence (41.2%). All the carcinomas were classified as luminal, and cytogenetics analysis demonstrated a high chromosomal instability with significant aneuploidy observed in all cases and polyploidy detected in 62.5%. This study holds significance as canine and human breast cancers share similar characteristics, suggesting that dogs could be a valuable model for human breast cancer research. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to enhance our understanding of CMTs."
"In the current study, we have investigated the secondary metabolites present in ethnomedical plants used for medicinal purposes-Astilbe chinensis (EK1), Scutellaria barbata D. Don (EK2), Uncaria rhynchophylla (EK3), Fallugia paradoxa (EK4), and Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Thread (EK5)-and we have compared them with five compounds of synthetic origin for the inhibition of PARP-1, which is linked to abnormal DNA replication, generating carcinogenic cells. We have studied these interactions through molecular dynamics simulations of each interacting system under physiological conditions (pH, temperature, and pressure) and determined that the compounds of natural origin have a capacity to inhibit PARP-1 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1) in all the cases inspected in this investigation. However, it is essential to mention that their interaction energy is relatively lower compared to that of compounds of synthetic origin. Given that binding energy is mandatory for the generation of a scale or classification of which is the best interacting agent, we can say that we assume that compounds of natural origin, having a complexation affinity with PARP-1, induce cell apoptosis, a potential route for the prevention of the proliferation of carcinogenic cells."
"Globally, hormone-responsive cancers afflict millions of people contributing to cancer-related morbidity and mortality. While hormone-responsive cancers overburden patients, their close families, and even health budgets at the local levels, knowledge of these cancers particularly their biology and possible avenues for therapy remains poorly exploited.

"Modern cancer therapies greatly improve clinical outcomes for both early and advanced breast cancer patients. However, these advances have raised concerns about potential short- and long-term toxicities, including cardiovascular toxicities. Therefore, understanding the common risk factors and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular toxicity is essential to ensure best breast cancer outcomes. While cardio-oncology has emerged as a sub-speciality to address these challenges, it is essential that all cardiologists recognize and understand the cardiovascular consequences of cancer therapy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential adverse cardiovascular effects associated with modern breast cancer therapies. A preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic workflow to minimize the impact of cardiovascular toxicity on patient outcomes is presented. Key aspects of this workflow include regular monitoring of cardiovascular function, early detection and management of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicities, and optimization of cardiovascular risk factor control. By highlighting the gaps in knowledge in some areas, this review aims to emphasize the critical role of cardio-oncology research in ensuring the holistic well-being of patients with breast cancer. © The Author(s) 2024.

"Breast reconstruction after mastectomy helps women with breast cancer feel better about their bodies and lives. There is debate about the best time and type of reconstruction (immediate versus delayed, and using own tissue versus implants). Long-term studies are rare. This study looked at long-term results of different breast reconstruction methods and timings in Swedish women who had mastectomies in 2000, 2005 or 2010. It focused on how satisfied the women were with their surgeries and their quality of life. The study included 5853 women from the Swedish National Breast Cancer Registry who had mastectomies in 2000, 2005 or 2010. Of these, 2904 women answered the survey, and 895 had breast reconstruction. Satisfaction and quality of life were measured using two surveys: EORTC QLQ-BRECON23 and BREAST-Q. Of the women who answered the survey, 895 (31%) had breast reconstruction. Of these, 176 (20%) had immediate reconstruction, and 719 (80%) had delayed reconstruction; 58% had implant-based reconstructions, 31% had reconstructions using their own tissue, 2% had both types and 9% did not report the type of reconstruction. There were no major differences in satisfaction between immediate and delayed reconstruction. Women who used their own tissue were more satisfied with their results and breast appearance than those with implants. Autologous reconstruction leads to better satisfaction and outcomes than implants. The timing of reconstruction (immediate versus delayed) was less of an influence on quality of life. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of BJS Foundation Ltd."
"Image-guided biopsy is an integral step in the diagnosis and management of suspicious image-detected breast or axillary lesions, allowing for accurate diagnosis and, if indicated, treatment planning. Tissue sampling can be performed under guidance of a full spectrum of breast imaging modalities, including stereotactic, tomosynthesis, sonographic, and MRI, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. Procedural planning, which includes consideration of technical, patient, and lesion factors, is vital for diagnostic accuracy and limitation of complications. The purpose of this paper is to review and provide guidance for breast imaging radiologists in selecting the best procedural approach for the individual patient to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal patient outcomes. Common patient and lesion factors that may affect successful sampling and contribute to postbiopsy complications are reviewed and include obesity, limited patient mobility, patient motion, patients prone to vasovagal reactions, history of anticoagulation, and lesion location, such as proximity to vital structures or breast implant. © Society of Breast Imaging 2024.

"Surgical resection is the best-known approach for breast cancer treatment. However, post-operative metastases increase the rate of death. The potential effect of anesthetic drugs on long-term tumor growth, risk of metastasis, and recurrence after surgery has been investigated in cancer patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the anti-metastatic effect of lidocaine combined with common anesthetics and its mechanisms of action on lung metastasis in breast cancer models. The combination of lidocaine with propofol or sevoflurane inhibited the growth of TNBC cells compared to treatment alone. In addition, the combination effectively inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. It suppressed tumor growth and increased the survival rate in breast 4 T1 orthotopic models. More importantly, it inhibited lung metastasis and recurrence compared with groups treated with a single anesthetic. In co-culture with TAMs and TNBC cells, lidocaine not only reduced M2-tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that were increased by sevoflurane or propofol but also increased M1 macrophage polarization, impeding tumor growth in TNBC. Also, we found that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) derived from TAMs increased EMT signaling in TNBC cells, and that lidocaine affected cancer cells as well as M2-TAMs, inducing M2 to M1 reprogramming and decreasing TGF-β/Smads-mediated EMT signaling in TNBC cells, leading to inhibition of cancer metastasis and recurrence. These findings suggest lidocaine combined with general anesthetics as a potential therapeutic approach for the inhibition of recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer patients undergoing curative resection.

"Image-based data mining (IBDM) requires spatial normalisation to reference anatomy, which is challenging in breast radiotherapy due to variations in the treatment position, breast shape and volume. We aim to optimise spatial normalisation for breast IBDM. Data from 996 patients treated with radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, recruited in the REQUITE study, were included. Patients were treated supine (n = 811), with either bilateral or ipsilateral arm(s) raised (551/260, respectively) or in prone position (n = 185). Four deformable image registration (DIR) configurations for extrathoracic spatial normalisation were tested. We selected the best-performing DIR configuration and further investigated two pathways:  i ii DIR using B-spline and normalised mutual information (NMI) performed the best across all evaluation metrics. Supine-supine registrations yielded highest accuracy (0.98 ± 0.01, 0.91 ± 0.04, 0.23 ± 0.19 cm, 1.17 ± 1.18 cm, 0.51 ± 0.26 cm for NCC, DSC, MDA, 95 %HD, and ILRU), followed by prone-prone and supine-prone registrations. Arm positioning had no significant impact on registration performance. For the best DIR strategy, uncertainty of 0.44 and 0.81 cm in the breast and shoulder regions was found. B-spline algorithm using NMI and registered supine and prone cohorts independently provides the most optimal spatial normalisation strategy for breast IBDM. © 2024 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Society of Radiotherapy & Oncology."
"Being implicated in bone metastasis development, bone sialoprotein (BSP) expression is upregulated in patients with cancer.

"This study aimed to assess the targeted nano-therapy of encapsulated cisplatin (Cis) and anthocyanin (Ant)-loaded multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) coated with chitosan conjugated folic acid on breast MCF7 and liver HepG2 cancer cells. Zeta potential, UV-spectroscopy, FTIR, TEM, and SEM were used to evaluate CNT, its modified form (CNT Mod), CNT-loaded Cis NPs, CNT-loaded Ant NPs, and CNT- Cis + Ant NPs. All treatments induced apoptosis-dependent cytotoxicity in both cell lines as revealed functionally by the MTT assay, morphologically (DNA degradation) by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining, and molecularly (Bax upregulation and Bcl2 downregulation) by real-time PCR, with best effect for the combined treatment (CNT- Cis + Ant NPs). This combined treatment also significantly reduced inflammation (low TNFα), migration (low MMP9 and high TIMP1), and angiogenesis (low VEGF), while significantly increasing antioxidant status (high Nrf2 and OH-1) in MCF7 and HepG2 cells compared to other treatments. Interestingly, cells treated with CNT Mod exhibited higher cytotoxic, apoptotic, anti-migratory, and anti-angiogenic potentials relative to CNT-treated cells. In conclusion, targeted nano-therapy of encapsulated cisplatin and anthocyanin-loaded carbon nanotubes coated with chitosan conjugated folic acid can efficiently combat breast and liver cancers by sustained release, in addition to its apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-metastatic, and anti-angiogenic effects.

"Breast tissue markers are essential in localising tumours post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to breast-conserving surgery. However, due to the advancement in neoadjuvant therapies, greater efficacy in reducing tumour size increases the possibility of marker migration, potentially compromising surgical outcomes. We report a case of a 34-year-old woman with left breast invasive carcinoma, where the tissue marker, placed under ultrasound guidance before chemotherapy, migrated and was undetectable after eight chemotherapy cycles. The delay in surgery was resolved by identifying the marker in the left pectoral muscle using CT, though proximity to the lung prevented hook wire placement. Proposed migration mechanisms include the ""accordion effect"" and haematoma-induced displacement, highlighting the dynamic nature of breast tissue. Various imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and CT, have proven helpful for marker localisation. This case underscores the need for a deeper understanding of tissue dynamics and emphasises interdisciplinary communication to adapt treatment strategies. As medical knowledge continues to evolve, insights are needed to refine best practices in breast cancer management and radiological interventions. Copyright © 2024, Subramaniam et al."

"Dishevelled, EGL-10 and pleckstrin domain-containing 1 (DEPDC1) has been identified as a crucial factor in the development and progression of various types of cancer. This protein, which is largely undetectable in normal tissues but is highly expressed in numerous tumor types, serves a significant role in cell mitosis, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, DEPDC1 is implicated in several key signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival. The expression of DEPDC1 has been linked to poor prognosis and survival rates in multiple types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Notably, DEPDC1 has been suggested to have potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, as well as a therapeutic target. Its involvement in critical signaling pathways suggests that targeting DEPDC1 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, thereby improving patient outcomes. In addition, clinical trials have shown promising results for DEPDC1-derived peptide vaccines, indicating their safety and potential efficacy in cancer treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review addressing the role of DEPDC1 in cancer. Through a critical analysis of existing studies, the present review aimed to consolidate existing knowledge and highlight gaps in understanding, paving the way for future research to elucidate the complex interactions of DEPDC1 in the context of cancer biology.

": To explore the diagnostic value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based on real-time dynamic ultrasound imaging system for minimal breast lesions. Minimal breast lesions with a maximum diameter of ≤10mm were selected in this prospective study. The ultrasound equipment and AI system were activated Simultaneously. The ultrasound imaging video is connected to the server of AI system to achieve simultaneous output of AI and ultrasound scanning. Dynamic observation of breast lesions was conducted via ultrasound. And these lesions were evaluated and graded according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification system through deep learning (DL) algorithms in AI. Surgical pathology was taken as the gold standard, and ROC curves were drawn to determine the area under the curve (AUC) and the optimal threshold values of BI-RADS. The diagnostic efficacy was compared with the use of a BI-RADS category >3 as the threshold for clinically intervening in diagnosing minimal breast cancers. 291 minimal breast lesions were enrolled in the study, of which 228 were benign (78.35%) and 63 were malignant (21.65%). The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.833, with the best threshold value >4A. When using >BI-RADS 3 and >BI-RADS 4A as threshold values, the sensitivity and negative predictive value for minimal breast cancers were higher for >BI-RADS 3 than >BI-RADS 4A (100% vs 65.08%, 100% vs 89.91%, P values <0.001). However, the corresponding specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy were lower than those for >BI-RADS 4A (42.11% vs 85.96%, 32.31% vs 56.16%, and 54.64% vs 81.44%, P values <0.001). The AI-based real-time dynamic ultrasound imaging system shows good capacity in diagnosing minimal breast lesions, which is helpful for early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, and improves the prognosis of patients. However, it still results in some missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses of minimal breast cancers. © 2024 Qu et al."
"The coexistence of aortic stenosis (AS) and neoplastic pathology are common due to shared risk factors with atherosclerotic disease, such as diabetes, inflammatory conditions, and smoking. Severe AS in patients with cancer requires careful assessment in order to select the appropriate therapeutic choices and their timing (i.e. valve treatment first vs. cancer treatment first). A 66-year-old woman with a history of smoking was admitted to our centre due to heart failure (HF). During her hospitalization, severe AS with severe ventricular dysfunction and cancer were documented. Because of her severe heart disease, she was unable to receive antineoplastic treatment. Therefore, she underwent percutaneous surgery to treat the aortic valve. After that, the management of cancer became possible, which included bilateral radical mastectomy and chemotherapy.We are presenting a case of cancer coexisting with aortic stenosis and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. In this case, we performed Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) with the aim of improving the ejection fraction, followed by chemotherapy. Cancer patients may be further disadvantaged by AS if it interferes with their treatment by increasing the risk associated with oncologic surgery and compounding the risks associated with cardiotoxicity and HF. Clinical trials and guidelines on TAVR exclude cohorts with limited life expectancy. Hence, the correct and optimal care for cancer patients with severe AS is complex. The TAVR, for cancer patients with severe AS, can more frequently be the best clinical choice by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass, minimal invasiveness, and therefore, shorter recovery time. © The Author(s) 2024.

"Financial toxicity is an important issue in cancer that affects quality of life and treatment adherence. Screening can identify patients at risk but consensus on appropriate timing or methods is lacking. We sent an anonymous survey to e-mail subscribers of a nationwide breast cancer-specific philanthropic organization in July 2023 asking about financial toxicity screening preferences. Frequencies, percentages, and medians were calculated for categorical and continuous variables. Of 5,774 potential participants, 738 respondents with a confirmed cancer diagnosis participated (12.7% response rate). Participants were 93% female (n = 690), had a median age of 50 years (IQR, 44-57), were 57% non-Hispanic White (n = 418), 20% Black/African-American (n = 149), 9.2% Hispanic (n = 68). 93% confirmed a breast cancer diagnosis (n = 689), and 54% were currently undergoing treatment (n = 400). Most indicated not being asked about financial stressors by (58%, n = 425) and not receiving assistance from their care team (68%, n = 498). Most preferred for providers to reach out regarding financial needs (83%, n = 615). Most wished for these discussions to take place early (when first diagnosed [45%, n = 334] or when treatment selected [37%, n = 275]) and to be asked frequently (each appointment [42%, n = 312] or once per month [36%, n = 268]). Participants felt most comfortable discussing financial needs with a social worker or patient/financial navigator (92%, n = 679), in person (75%, n = 553), or via telephone (65%, n = 479). Patients in this sample primarily consisting of women with breast cancer desired financial screening to occur early, often, and to be initiated by their providers. Patient preferences can inform optimal implementation of financial toxicity screening practices. Continued work refining best practices for financial toxicity screening should incorporate these patient preferences."
"To evaluate the performance of ultrasound-based deep learning (DL) models in distinguishing breast phyllodes tumors (PTs) from fibroadenomas (FAs) and their clinical utility in assisting radiologists with varying diagnostic experiences. We retrospectively collected 1180 ultrasound images from 539 patients (247 PTs and 292 FAs). Five DL network models with different structures were trained and validated using nodule regions annotated by radiologists on breast ultrasound images. DL models were trained using the methods of transfer learning and 3-fold cross-validation. The model demonstrated the best evaluation index in the 3-fold cross-validation was selected for comparison with radiologists' diagnostic decisions. Two-round reader studies were conducted to investigate the value of DL model in assisting six radiologists with different levels of experience. Upon testing, Xception model demonstrated the best diagnostic performance (AUC: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.92), outperforming all radiologists (all p < 0.05). Additionally, the DL model enhanced the diagnostic performance of radiologists. Accuracy demonstrated improvements of 4%, 4%, and 3% for senior, intermediate, and junior radiologists, respectively. The DL models showed superior predictive abilities compared to experienced radiologists in distinguishing breast PTs from FAs. Utilizing the model led to improved efficiency and diagnostic performance for radiologists with different levels of experience (6-25 years of work). We developed and validated a DL model based on the largest available dataset to assist in diagnosing PTs. This model has the potential to allow radiologists to discriminate two types of breast tumors which are challenging to identify with precision and accuracy, and subsequently to make more informed decisions about surgical plans. © The Author(s) 2024.

"Breast cancer emerges as one of the most prevalent malignancies in women, its incidence showing a concerning upward trend. Among the diverse array of breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) assumes notable significance, due to lack of estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2 receptors. More focus has to be placed on creating effective therapy due to the high prevalence and rising incidence of TNBC. Currently, conventional passive treatments have several drawbacks that have not yet been resolved. On the other hand, as innovative immunotherapy approaches, cancer vaccines have offered promising prospects in combatting advanced stages of TNBC. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to utilize WT1 and NY-ESO-1 antigenic proteins in designing a multiepitope vaccine against TNBC. Initially, to generate robust immune responses, we identified antigenic epitopes of both proteins and assessed their immunogenicity. In order to reduce junctional immunogenicity, promiscuous epitopes were joined using the suitable adjuvant (50S ribosomal L7/L12 protein) and incorporated appropriate linkers (GPGPG, AAY, and EAAAK). The best predicted 3D model was refined and validated to achieve an excellent 3D model. Molecular docking analysis and dynamic simulation were conducted to demonstrate the structural stability and integrity of the vaccine/TLR-4 complex. Finally, the vaccine was cloned into the vector pET28 (+). Thus, analysis of the constructed vaccine through immunoinformatics indicates its capability to elicit robust humoral and cellular immune responses in the targeted organism. As such, it holds promise as a therapeutic weapon against TNBC and may open doors for further research in the field. © 2024 The Authors."
"Acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) of the breast is a rare malignant epithelial neoplasm, with approximately 60 cases reported in the literature. It predominantly affects women and exhibits significant histological heterogeneity. The diagnosis of breast AciCC is primarily based on the presence of eosinophilic and/or basophilic granular cytoplasm and markers of serous acinar differentiation. Despite being considered a low-grade variant of conventional triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), over 25% of patients with breast AciCC have adverse clinical outcomes. Additionally, in early research, microglandular adenosis (MGA) and atypical MGA were considered potential precursors for various breast cancers, including intraductal carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, and AciCC. Similarly, some studies have proposed that breast AciCC should be considered a type of carcinoma developing in MGA with acinic cell differentiation rather than a distinct entity. Therefore, the pathogenesis of breast AciCC has not yet been clarified. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the literature has not summarized the latest prognosis and treatment of breast AciCC. In this review, we synthesized the current literature and the latest developments, aiming at exploring the clinicopathology, histological origin, molecular features, prognosis, and treatment of breast AciCC from a novel perspective.

"Tumor progression has been linked to stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM) caused by fibrosis. Cancer cells can be mechanically conditioned by stiff ECM, exhibiting a 1004-gene signature (MeCo score). Nintedanib has demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This study explores nintedanib's anti-fibrotic effect on breast cancer outcomes. We present long-term follow-up and analysis of a neoadjuvant randomized Phase 2 trial in early HER2-negative breast cancer. Patients (N = 130) underwent a baseline biopsy and received 12 paclitaxel courses alone (control arm) or in combination with nintedanib (experimental arm). Tumor MeCo score was determined by RNAseq. The primary aim was to assess nintedanib's impact on event-free survival (EFS) based on MeCo scores. Follow-up data were retrieved from 111 patients; 75 baseline and 24 post-run-in phase samples were sequenced. After median follow-up of 9.67 years, median EFS was not statistically different between arms (P = 0.37). However, in the control arm, High versus Low MeCo patients had a statistically higher relapse risk: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.21; P = 0.0075. This risk was corrected by nintedanib in the experimental arm: HR = 0.37; P = 0.16. Nintedanib demonstrated pharmacodynamic engagement, reducing the MeCo score by 25% during the run-in phase (P<0.01). Patients with Low MeCo after run-in had the best long-term prognosis (HR = 0.087; P = 0.03). High MeCo is predictive of poor outcomes in HER2-negative early breast cancer, although this risk can be mitigated by nintedanib, which is able to specifically reduce mechanical conditioning."
"Chemotherapy remains a commonly used and important treatment option for metastatic breast cancer. A majority of ER+ metastatic breast cancer patients ultimately develop resistance to chemotherapy, resulting in disease progression. We hypothesized that an ""evolutionary double-bind"", where treatment with one drug improves the response to a different agent, would improve the effectiveness and durability of responses to chemotherapy. This approach exploits vulnerabilities in acquired resistance mechanisms. Evolutionary models can be used in refractory cancer to identify alternative treatment strategies that capitalize on acquired vulnerabilities and resistance traits for improved outcomes. To develop and test these models, ER+ breast cancer cell lineages sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy are grown in spheroids with varied initial population frequencies to measure cross-sensitivity and efficacy of chemotherapy and add-on treatments such as disulfiram combination treatment. Different treatment schedules then assessed the best strategy for reducing the selection of resistant populations. We developed and parameterized a game-theoretic mathematical model from this in vitro experimental data, and used it to predict the existence of a double-bind where selection for resistance to chemotherapy induces sensitivity to disulfiram. The model predicts a dose-dependent re-sensitization (a double-bind) to chemotherapy for monotherapy disulfiram."
"The effect of cancer in women has varied effects. Overall malignancies of the breast, cervix, and ovary account for over 43% of all cancer cases in India. Globally, cervical cancer is fourth cancer in terms of incidence among women, following breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. However, this illness primarily affects women in India, where it is the second most frequent malignancy after breast cancer. HPV-related cervical cancer is a serious public health issue that has a solution. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global initiative to eliminate cervical cancer which set targets for three important strategies: HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and treatment. The WHO's ""Best Buys"" recommendations for cancer sub-set place vaccination of females between the ages of 9 and 14 at the top of the list. In India, efforts are underway to increase the number of teenage girls receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The nation granted licenses for bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccinations in 2008, and in 2018, a nonavalent vaccine was approved. It is important to keep in mind that the cervical carcinoma vaccination is not a quick fix; thus, screening for the disease should continue. Any nation can potentially significantly lower the incidence of cervical cancer by carefully combining economical, high-coverage vaccinations with well-organized screening programs. Since 9-14 years is the ideal age range before sexual debut in today's world, this is the key vaccine age range. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness for younger adolescents, those between the ages of 9 and 14 years, varied from roughly 74 to 93%. Let us envision an India of the future where girls grow up with one fewer cancer threatening their life and a place where cervical cancer has been eradicated. © Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India 2024."
"Recent trials have shown the efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in HER2-negative patients, but there is not yet a way to identify which patients will best respond, especially with the inability of current HER2 IHC and FISH assays to accurately determine HER2 expression in the unamplified setting. Here, we present a heavily pre-treated patient with triple-negative breast cancer (HER2 IHC 0 who had a complete response to T-DXd. In this case, we used a CLIA-certified reverse-phase protein array-based proteomic assay (RPPA) to determine that the patient had moderate HER2 protein expression (HER2 Total Y1248 © 2024.
