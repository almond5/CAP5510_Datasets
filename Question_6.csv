During the past recent years, various therapies emerged in the era of breast 
cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic and 
environmental factors are involved. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are the 
main player in the aggressiveness of different tumors and also, these cells are 
the main challenge in cancer treatment. Moreover, the major obstacle to achieve 
an effective treatment is resistance to therapies. There are various types of 
treatment for breast cancer (BC) patients. Therefore, in this review, we present 
the current treatments, novel approaches such as antibody-drug conjugation 
systems (ADCs), nanoparticles (albumin-, metal-, lipid-, polymer-, micelle-based 
nanoparticles), and BCSCs-based therapies. Furthermore, prognostic and 
predictive biomarkers will be discussed also biomarkers that have been applied 
by some tests such as Oncotype DX, Mamm αPrint, and uPA/PAI-1 are regarded as 
suitable prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common global malignancy and the leading cause of 
cancer deaths. Despite this, undergraduate and postgraduate exposure to breast 
cancer is limited, impacting on the ability of clinicians to accurately 
recognise, assess and refer appropriate patients. This article provides a 
comprehensive review of the pathology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, 
referral pathways and management of breast cancer in the UK. It also describes 
how to conduct a thorough clinical breast examination.

Breast cancer is one of the three most common cancers worldwide. Early breast 
cancer is considered potentially curable. Therapy has progressed substantially 
over the past years with a reduction in therapy intensity, both for locoregional 
and systemic therapy; avoiding overtreatment but also undertreatment has become 
a major focus. Therapy concepts follow a curative intent and need to be decided 
in a multidisciplinary setting, taking molecular subtype and locoregional tumour 
load into account. Primary conventional surgery is not the optimal choice for 
all patients any more. In triple-negative and HER2-positive early breast cancer, 
neoadjuvant therapy has become a commonly used option. Depending on clinical 
tumour subtype, therapeutic backbones include endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 
targeting, and chemotherapy. In metastatic breast cancer, therapy goals are 
prolongation of survival and maintaining quality of life. Advances in endocrine 
therapies and combinations, as well as targeting of HER2, and the promise of 
newer targeted therapies make the prospect of long-term disease control in 
metastatic breast cancer an increasing reality.

Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health dilemma and is currently the 
most common tumour in the globe. Awareness of breast cancer, public 
attentiveness, and advancement in breast imaging has made a positive impact on 
recognition and screening of breast cancer. Breast cancer is life-threatening 
disease in females and the leading cause of mortality among women population. 
For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer has guided to 
astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in 
further proficient treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer 
is considered as one of the leading cause of death in post menopausal women 
accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it 
is diagnosed in their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding 
the self inspection and clinical examination of the breast. This review 
addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, 
pathogenesis of breast cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic 
investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted 
therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary 
therapies, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy etc for breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the 
second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly-diagnosed cancers. There 
is much evidence showing the influence of life style and environmental factors 
on the development of mammary gland cancer (high-fat diet, alcohol consumption, 
lack of physical exercise), the elimination of which (primary prevention) may 
contribute to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. Secondary prevention, 
comprising diagnostic tests (e.g. mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic 
resonance imaging, breast self-examination, as well as modern and more precise 
imaging methods) help the early detection of tumours or lesions predisposing to 
tumours.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study paper is to review current knowledge and 
reports regarding primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.
STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: It is estimated that nearly 70% of malign tumours are caused 
by environmental factors, whereas in breast cancer this percentage reaches 
90-95%. There are national programmes established in many countries to fight 
cancer, where both types of prevention are stressed as serving to decrease 
morbidity and mortality due to cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer prevention is currently playing a key role in the fight 
against the disease. Behaviour modification, as well as greater awareness among 
women regarding breast cancer, may significantly contribute towards reducing the 
incidence of this cancer. Another important aspect is the number of women 
undergoing diagnostic tests, which still remains at an unsatisfactory level.

Breast cancer remains a public-health issue on a global scale. We report new 
information about the disease from the past 5 years. Early age at first birth, 
increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction 
in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be 
renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening 
nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that 
only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be 
targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most 
effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. 
Additionally, MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial 
breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are 
promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be 
offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly 
used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary 
diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis 
properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Pathological image 
processing of breast has become an important means for early diagnosis of breast 
cancer. Using medical image processing to assist doctors to detect potential 
breast cancer as early as possible has always been a hot topic in the field of 
medical image diagnosis. In this paper, a breast cancer recognition method based 
on image processing is systematically expounded from four aspects: breast cancer 
detection, image segmentation, image registration, and image fusion. The 
achievements and application scope of supervised learning, unsupervised 
learning, deep learning, CNN, and so on in breast cancer examination are 
expounded. The prospect of unsupervised learning and transfer learning for 
breast cancer diagnosis is prospected. Finally, the privacy protection of breast 
cancer patients is put forward.

Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care 
for their patients during and after cancer treatment. This article reviews 
typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma 
in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to 
invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation 
therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and 
II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and 
radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery 
decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for 
most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does 
not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with 
axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on 
lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or 
HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, 
node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine 
therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer 
overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic 
regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically 
requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate 
breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage 
III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, 
rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection 
and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or 
metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits 
in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.

The progesterone receptor (PR) modulates estrogen receptors α (ERα) action in 
breast cancer; it is an upregulated target gene of ER, and its expression is 
dependent on estrogen. PR is also a valuable prognostic biomarker in breast 
cancer, especially in hormone-positive breast cancer. High expression of PR is 
more frequently observed in tumors with a better baseline prognosis (ie, luminal 
A) than tumors with a poor baseline prognosis (ie, luminal B). In the following 
review, we present the role of PR in breast cancer, including the genomic 
characteristics and pathways in breast cancer, PR and endocrine therapy.

Despite dramatic advances in cancer research setting, breast cancer remains a 
major health problem and represents currently a top biomedical research 
priority. Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, 
and its incidence and mortality rates are expected to increase significantly the 
next years. Recently the researchers' interest has been attracted by breast 
cancer arising in young women. Current evidence suggests that in women aged 
<45 years, breast cancer is unquestionably the leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths. This type of cancer seems to be highly heterogeneous and has potentially 
aggressive and complex biological features. However, management strategies, 
recommendations and options are not age based and the 'complex' biology of this 
type of cancer remains uncertain and unexplored. In this review, we summarize 
the latest scientific information on breast cancer arising in young women 
highlighting the heterogeneity and the complex nature of this type of cancer.

The analysis of the causes that have given rise to a change in tendency in the 
incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer in the last few decades generates 
important revelations regarding the role of breast screening, the regular 
application of adjuvant therapies and the change of risk factors. The benefits 
of early detection have been accompanied by certain adverse effects, even in 
terms of an excessive number of prophylactic mastectomies. Recently, several 
updates have been published on the recommendations in breast cancer screening at 
an international level. On the other hand, the advances in genomics have made it 
possible to establish a new molecular classification of breast cancer. Our aim 
is to present an updated overview of the epidemiological situation of breast 
cancer, as well as some relevant issues from the point of view of diagnosis, 
such as molecular classification and different strategies for both 
population-based and opportunistic screening.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second 
among causes for cancer related death in women. Evidence in literature has shown 
that the past and ongoing research has an enormous implication in improving the 
clinical outcome in breast cancer. This has been attributed to the progress made 
in the realm of screening, diagnosis and therapeutic strategies engaged in 
breast cancer management. However, poor prognosis in TNBC and drug resistance 
presents major inhibitions which are also current challenges for containing the 
disease. Similarly, a focal point of concern is the rising rate of breast cancer 
incidence and mortality among the population of under developed world. In this 
chapter, an overview of the current practices for the diagnosis and treatment of 
breast cancer and associated impediments has been provided.

With increasing life expectancy and growth of the elderly US population, it 
becomes paramount that breast cancer research focuses more on the prevention, 
screening, and treatment of these patients. Age is no longer a cutoff for 
managing breast cancer in the elderly. Studies have shown the current 
undertreatment of cancer undermines survival, but the tide is turning to provide 
evidence-based medicine for the elderly. More often, clinicians and surgeons 
look not only at tumor-specific characteristics of breast cancer but also the 
functionality, tolerance, comorbidities, and life expectancy of patients to 
determine the best treatment.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the United States and 
around the world. Although widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic and 
hormonal agents has improved mortality from breast cancer, it remains 
challenging to determine on an individual basis who will benefit from such 
treatments and who will be likely to encounter toxicities. With the rising costs 
of healthcare and the introduction of new targeted therapies, use of biomarkers 
has emerged as a method of assisting with breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, 
prediction of therapeutic response, and surveillance of disease during and after 
treatment. In the following review, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, their 
utility in the management of patients with breast cancer, and current 
recommendations regarding their clinical use will be discussed.

Histological types of breast cancer: how special are they?

Laboratories, London WC2A 3PX, UK.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, comprising multiple entities 
associated with distinctive histological and biological features, clinical 
presentations and behaviours and responses to therapy. Microarray-based 
technologies have unravelled the molecular underpinning of several 
characteristics of breast cancer, including metastatic propensity and 
histological grade, and have led to the identification of prognostic and 
predictive gene expression signatures. Furthermore, a molecular taxonomy of 
breast cancer based on transcriptomic analysis has been proposed. However, 
microarray studies have primarily focused on invasive ductal carcinomas of no 
special type. Owing to the relative rarity of special types of breast cancer, 
information about the biology and clinical behaviour of breast cancers conveyed 
by histological type has not been taken into account. Histological special types 
of breast cancer account for up to 25% of all invasive breast cancers. Recent 
studies have provided direct evidence of the existence of genotypic-phenotypic 
correlations. For instance, secretory carcinomas of the breast consistently 
harbour the t(12;15) translocation that leads to the formation of the ETV6-NTRK3 
fusion gene, adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently display the t(6;9) MYB-NFIB 
translocation and lobular carcinomas consistently show inactivation of the CDH1 
gene through multiple molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, histopathological and 
molecular analysis of tumours from conditional mouse models has provided direct 
evidence for the causative role of specific genes in the genesis of specific 
histological special types of breast cancer. Here we review the associations 
between the molecular taxonomy of breast cancer and histological special types, 
discuss the possible origins of the heterogeneity of breast cancer and propose 
an approach for the identification of novel therapeutic targets based on the 
study of histological special types of breast cancer.

Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is an uncommon aggressive malignancy that is 
associated with a poor prognosis. Due to its rarity, the relationships between 
the clinical and pathological features of MpBC, treatment approach, and clinical 
outcomes remain underexplored. In the following review article, we synthesize 
the existing data on the clinical, pathological and genomic features, 
management, and outcomes of MpBC. We also identify potential targets for future 
clinical trials.

In this article, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of female 
breast cancer statistics in the United States, including trends in incidence, 
mortality, survival, and screening. Approximately 230,480 new cases of invasive 
breast cancer and 39,520 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US 
women in 2011. Breast cancer incidence rates were stable among all racial/ethnic 
groups from 2004 to 2008. Breast cancer death rates have been declining since 
the early 1990s for all women except American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom 
rates have remained stable. Disparities in breast cancer death rates are evident 
by state, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. While significant declines 
in mortality rates were observed for 36 states and the District of Columbia over 
the past 10 years, rates for 14 states remained level. Analyses by county-level 
poverty rates showed that the decrease in mortality rates began later and was 
slower among women residing in poor areas. As a result, the highest breast 
cancer death rates shifted from the affluent areas to the poor areas in the 
early 1990s. Screening rates continue to be lower in poor women compared with 
non-poor women, despite much progress in increasing mammography utilization. In 
2008, 51.4% of poor women had undergone a screening mammogram in the past 2 
years compared with 72.8% of non-poor women. Encouraging patients aged 40 years 
and older to have annual mammography and a clinical breast examination is the 
single most important step that clinicians can take to reduce suffering and 
death from breast cancer. Clinicians should also ensure that patients at high 
risk of breast cancer are identified and offered appropriate screening and 
follow-up. Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require 
sustained and increased efforts to provide high-quality screening, diagnosis, 
and treatment to all segments of the population.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare form of breast cancer that accounts 
for only 2% to 4% of all breast cancer cases. Despite its low incidence, IBC 
contributes to 7% to 10% of breast cancer caused mortality. Despite ongoing 
international efforts to formulate better diagnosis, treatment, and research, 
the survival of patients with IBC has not been significantly improved, and there 
are no therapeutic agents that specifically target IBC to date. The authors 
present a comprehensive overview that aims to assess the present and new 
management strategies of IBC.

PURPOSE: Inflammatory breast cancer is a deadly and aggressive type of breast 
cancer. A key challenge relates to the need for a more detailed, formal, 
objective definition of IBC, the lack of which compromises clinical care, 
hampers the conduct of clinical trials, and hinders the search for IBC-specific 
biomarkers and treatments because of the heterogeneity of patients considered to 
have IBC.
METHODS: Susan G. Komen, the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and 
the Milburn Foundation convened patient advocates, clinicians, and researchers 
to review the state of IBC and to propose initiatives to advance the field. 
After literature review of the defining clinical, pathologic, and imaging 
characteristics of IBC, the experts developed a novel quantitative scoring 
system for diagnosis.
RESULTS: The experts identified through consensus several ""defining 
characteristics"" of IBC, including factors related to timing of onset and 
specific symptoms. These reflect common pathophysiologic changes, sometimes 
detectable on biopsy in the form of dermal lymphovascular tumor emboli and often 
reflected in imaging findings. Based on the importance and extent of these 
characteristics, the experts developed a scoring scale that yields a continuous 
score from 0 to 48 and proposed cut-points for categorization that can be tested 
in subsequent validation studies.
CONCLUSION: To move beyond subjective 'clinical diagnosis' of IBC, we propose a 
quantitative scoring system to define IBC, based on clinical, pathologic, and 
imaging features. This system is intended to predict outcome and biology, guide 
treatment decisions and inclusion in clinical trials, and increase diagnostic 
accuracy to aid basic research; future validation studies are necessary to 
evaluate its performance.

A review of clinical aspects of breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second 
among causes for cancer related death in women. The ability to identify and 
diagnose breast cancer has improved markedly. Treatment decisions which were 
based in the past predominantly on the anatomic extent of the disease are 
shifting to the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene array technology has led 
to the recognition that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease composed of 
different biological subtypes, and genetic profiling enables response to 
chemotherapy to be predicted. Breast conservation became an established standard 
of care and the oncoplastic approach enables wide excisions without compromising 
the natural shape of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced 
axillary dissection as the standard procedure to stage the axilla and spared 
many patients the excess morbidity of axillary dissection. Targeted therapy to 
the oestrogen receptor plays a major role in systemic therapy; pathways 
responsible for endocrine resistance have been targeted as well. Biological 
therapy has been developed to target HER2 receptor and combination of antibody 
drug conjugates linked cytotoxic therapy to HER2 antibodies. Meaningful 
improvements in survival resulted from the new effective systemic agents and 
patients with metastasis are likely to have a longer survival.

Substantial progress has been made in contemporary breast cancer care, resulting 
in a consistently declining breast cancer mortality rate and an improvement in 
quality of life. Advancements include deescalation of therapy in low-risk 
populations and refining systemic therapy options. Research into molecular 
biomarkers continues to evolve and holds the promise of achieving the goal of 
precision medicine, while guidelines for supportive care and survivorship have 
been created to address the needs of an ever-increasing number of breast cancer 
survivors. A collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach is essential for 
patients and survivors to achieve optimal outcomes and enjoy productive 
high-quality lives. Gynecologists, in particular, play a key role in screening 
and survivorship care.

PURPOSE: The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual 
uses tumor size, lymph node, and metastatic status to stage breast cancer across 
different subtypes. We examined the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) versus non-TNBC within the same stages and sub-stages to evaluate whether 
TNBC had worse prognosis than non-TNBC.
METHODS: We reviewed the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) data and identified 158,358 patients diagnosed with 
breast cancer from 2010 to 2012. The overall survival (OS) time and breast 
cancer cause-specific survival time were compared between patients with TNBC and 
non-TNBC in each stage and sub-stages. The results were validated using a 
dataset of 2049 patients with longer follow-up from our institution.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with non-TNBC, patients with TNBC had worse OS 
and breast cancer cause-specific survival time in every stage and sub-stage in 
univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for age, race, tumor grade, and 
surgery and radiation treatments in the SEER data. The worse OS time in patients 
with TNBC was validated in our institutional dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TNBC have worse survival than patients with non-TNBC. 
The new AJCC staging manual should consider breast cancer biomarker information.

Breast cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent in the women greater than 
65 years of age. Most tumors are hormone receptor-positive in this group. Breast 
cancer screening recommendations for older women should be tailored based on 
life expectancy. Early stage breast cancer should be treated with conservative 
surgery followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy in HR+ patients. Primary 
endocrine therapy is a low-risk option for those with limited life expectancy. 
Adjuvant radiation therapy can be avoided in early stage, low-risk cancers. 
Evaluation should include comprehensive geriatric assessment. Treatment with 
less cytotoxic chemotherapy, HER-2 targeted therapies, and other 
biomarker-driven, molecularly targeted therapies should be sought whenever 
possible.

Breast cancer is the most frequent invasive malignancy and the second major 
cause of cancer death in female subjects mostly due to the considerable 
diagnostic delay and failure of therapeutic strategies. Thus, early diagnosis 
and possibility to monitor response to the treatment are of utmost importance. 
Identification of valid biomarkers, in particular new molecular therapeutic 
targets, that would allow screening, early patient identification, prediction of 
disease aggressiveness, and monitoring response to the therapeutic regimen has 
been in the focus of breast cancer research during recent decades. One of the 
intensively developing fields is nuclear medicine combining molecular diagnostic 
imaging and subsequent (radio)therapy in the light of theranostics. This review 
aimed to survey the current status of preclinical and clinical research using 
theranostic approach in breast cancer patients with potential to translate into 
conventional treatment strategies alone or in combination with other common 
treatments, especially in aggressive and resistant types of breast cancer. In 
addition, we present 5 patients with breast cancer who were refractory or 
relapsed after conventional therapy while presumably responded to the molecular 
radiotherapy with 177Lu-trastuzumab (Herceptin), 177Lu-DOTATATE, and 
177Lu-FAPI-46.

It has been suggested that physical activity in breast cancer patients can not 
only improve quality of life. Influences on physical and psychological levels 
have been evaluated, but effects on the immune system of breast cancer patients 
are hardly known. A PubMed search identified relevant trials and meta-analyses 
from 1970 to 2013. This review summarizes the results of international studies 
and the current discussion of effects of physical activity on the immune system 
of breast cancer patients. Highlighted are effects of physical activity on the 
immune system. Seven original articles and 14 reviews included in this review. 
Two original and the review articles includes other tumor entities besides 
breast cancer.Evaluated methods such as dose-response relationships for exercise 
in oncology, hardly exist. Increased immunological anti-cancer activity due to 
physical activity is probably mediated via an increase in number and 
cytotoxicity of monocytes and natural killer cells and cytokines.

Molecular Classification of Breast Cancer: Relevance and Challenges.

Zhang X(1).

Author information:

School of Rowan University, Camden, New Jersey.

CONTEXT.—: Appropriate patient management requires precise and meaningful tumor 
classification. Breast cancer classification continues to evolve from 
traditional morphologic evaluation to more sophisticated systems with the 
integration of new knowledge from research being translated into practice. 
Breast cancer is heterogeneous at the molecular level, with diversified patterns 
of gene expression, which is presumably responsible for the difference in tumor 
behavior and prognosis. Since the beginning of this century, new molecular 
technology has been gradually applied to breast cancer research on issues 
pertinent to prognosis (prognostic signature) and therapeutic prediction 
(predictive signature), and much progress has been made.
OBJECTIVE.—: To summarize the current state and the prospective future of 
molecular classification of breast cancer.
DATA SOURCES.—: Sources include recent medical literature on molecular 
classification of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Identification of intrinsic tumor subtypes has set a foundation 
for refining the breast cancer molecular classification. Studies have explored 
the genetic features within the intrinsic cancer subtypes and have identified 
novel molecular targets that led to the innovation of clinical assays to predict 
a patient's prognosis and to provide specific guidelines for therapeutic 
decisions. With the development and implication of these molecular tools, we 
have remarkably advanced our knowledge and enhanced our power to provide optimal 
management to patients. However, challenges still exist. Besides accurate 
prediction of prognosis, we are still in urgent need of more molecular 
predictors for tumor response to therapeutic regimes. Further exploration along 
this path will be critical for improving a patient's prognosis.

Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease that is categorized into 
several histological and genomic subtypes with relevant prognostic and 
therapeutical implications. Such diversity requires a multidisciplinary approach 
for a comprehensive treatment that will involve surgeons, radiotherapists and 
medical oncologists. Breast cancer is classified as either local (or 
locoregional), which stands for 90-95% of cases, or metastatic, representing 5% 
of cases. The management of breast cancer will be determined by the stage of the 
disease. The treatment of local breast cancer is based on surgery and/or 
radiotherapy. Systemic breast cancer requires chemotherapy and/or endocrine 
and/or biological therapy.

Breast cancer is a pathological condition characterized by high morphological 
and molecular heterogeneity. Not only the breast cancer cells, but also their 
tumor micro-environment consists of a multitude of cell types and states, which 
continuously evolve throughout progression of the disease. To understand breast 
cancer evolution within this complex environment, in situ analysis of breast 
cancer and their co-evolving cells and structures in space and time are 
essential. In this review, recent technical advances in three-dimensional (3D) 
and intravital imaging of breast cancer are discussed. Moreover, we highlight 
the resulting new knowledge on breast cancer biology obtained through these 
innovative imaging technologies. Finally, we discuss how multidimensional 
imaging technologies can be integrated with molecular profiling to understand 
the full complexity of breast cancer and the tumor micro-environment during 
tumor progression and treatment response.

Bilateral breast cancer.

Bilateral breast cancer has a cumulative incidence of 7% to 20% in patients with 
primary operable breast cancer, and the majority of these lesions are 
metachronous. A consensus on the management of the contralateral breast has been 
elusive. Much of the confusion arises from the fact that there exist marked 
differences of opinion regarding the impact of a second primary breast cancer on 
the overall prognosis. The risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer is 
influenced by the age of the patient, the presence of in situ disease, lobular 
histology of this new lesion, multicentricity, exposure to certain types of 
ionizing irradiation, and, possibly, family history of breast cancer. Management 
options include observation (clinical and mammographic surveillance), 
contralateral biopsy, and, rarely, prophylactic mastectomy. It is hoped that 
trials of breast cancer prevention, employing drugs such as tamoxifen, will 
identify agents capable of abrogating the risk of contralateral breast cancer 
and improve the ultimate outcome.

Nonfamilial breast cancer subtypes.

Over the last decade, our knowledge in somatic genetic events related to breast 
cancer has increased -enormously. Through usage of various genome-wide molecular 
approaches, it has become increasingly clear that breast cancer is a vastly 
heterogeneous disease. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has divided 
breast cancer into five distinct intrinsic subtypes termed basal-like, 
HER2-enriched, normal-like, luminal A, and luminal B. Importantly, these 
subtypes are closely correlated to clinical variables as well as different 
outcomes, with luminal A tumors as the good prognostic group. Initial studies 
using genome-wide DNA copy number data broadly partitioned breast cancers into 
three types, complex, amplifier, and simple, and moreover associated distinct 
copy number changes with the intrinsic subtypes defined by gene expression 
profiles. More recently, this genomic classification was refined into six 
genomic subtypes demonstrating strong resemblance to the intrinsic gene 
expression classification. Additionally, inherited BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated 
tumors were significantly correlated to specific subtypes. In this chapter, we 
will review the current status regarding genomic subtypes of nonfamilial breast 
cancer.

Metastatic breast cancer is generally considered incurable, and this colors 
doctor-patient interactions for patients with metastatic disease. Although true 
for most patients, there appear to be important exceptions, instances where 
long-term disease-free survival occurs. Although these instances are few in 
number, they suggest the possibility of cure. How will we move toward cure for a 
much larger population of patients with metastatic disease? This article 
outlines a potential research agenda that might move us toward that distant 
goal.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed nonskin cancer in women. To 
decrease the breast cancer burden, conserve resources, and decrease unnecessary 
treatments, guidelines suggest interventions be reserved for those women at 
greatest risk for disease. Risk assessment incorporating breast cancer risk 
factors and risk assessment models is of paramount importance in identifying 
women who have the greatest benefit from risk reduction strategies. Principles 
of shared decision-making should guide practitioners to incorporate patients' 
values, goals, and objectives in decisions around genetic testing, pharmacologic 
intervention, enhanced surveillance, and other risk reduction strategies.

Breast cancer: basics, screening, diagnostics and treatment.

[Article in English, German]

Wörmann B.

Breast cancer is by far the most common malignancy in women. The median age is 
64 years. Stage at diagnosis and biological features determine the prognosis. 
Patients with early breast cancer, with locally advanced disease and with 
locoregional relapse can be cured. Modern treatment is multimodal. It includes 
surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are 
treated with palliative intent. Aims are alleviation of symptoms and 
prolongation of survival. Breast cancer specific mortality has continually 
decreased in the past 10 years. Five year survival rate is 87% in Germany. 
Patients with early breast cancer have an even higher chance of cure.

Clinical database is a collection of clinical data related to patients, which 
can be used for analysis and research. Clinical data can be classified into 
several categories: patient-related, tumor-related, diagnostics-related, 
treatment-related, outcome-related, administration-related, and other clinical 
data. Clinical databases can be classified according to the data types of 
clinical databases, ranges of institutes, and accessibility to data. The numbers 
of papers and clinical trials are rapidly increasing. Recently, more than 9000 
papers related to breast cancer have been published annually, and more than 7000 
papers related to human breast cancer are published annually. The speed of 
increase is expected to be faster and faster in future. Now, almost 8000 
clinical trials are registered world widely. Main research areas of breast 
cancer can be classified into followings; epidemiology, screening and 
prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Clinical databases that are 
available for breast cancer research are also introduced in this chapter. The 
analysis of big data is expected to be the mainstream of breast cancer research 
using clinical databases. As the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) is 
rapidly evolving, the technology of deep learning starts to be applied for 
breast cancer research. In near future, AI technology is predicted to penetrate 
deeply the field of breast cancer research.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and survivors with this 
diagnosis account for almost one fourth of the over 14 million cancer survivors 
in the US. After several decades of basic and clinical trials research, we have 
learned much about the heterogeneity of breast cancer and have evolved a complex 
and multidisciplinary treatment approach to the disease. Increasingly, we are 
paying attention to the long term and late effects of breast cancer treatment, 
and this is largely the subject of this volume. In this chapter, the authors 
introduce the topic of breast cancer survivorship and highlight the organization 
and content of this volume, briefly describing the contents of the subsequent 
chapters.
