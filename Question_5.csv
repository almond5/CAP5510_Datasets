Despite advances in our understanding of risk, development, immunologic control, 
and treatment options for lung cancer, it remains the leading cause of cancer 
death. Tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor for lung cancer 
development. Nontobacco risk factors include environmental and occupational 
exposures, chronic lung disease, lung infections, and lifestyle factors. Because 
tobacco remains the leading risk factor for lung cancer, disease prevention is 
focused on smoking avoidance and cessation. Other prevention measures include 
healthy diet choices and maintaining a physically active lifestyle. Future work 
should focus on smoking cessation campaigns and better understanding disease 
development and treatment strategies in nonsmokers.

Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death. Screening for lung 
cancer by low-dose computed tomography improves mortality. Various modalities 
exist for diagnosis and staging. Treatment is determined by subtype and stage of 
cancer; there are several personalized therapies that did not exist just a few 
years ago. Caring for the patient with lung cancer is a complex task. This 
review provides a broad outline of this disease, helping clinicians identify 
such patients and familiarizing them with lung cancer care options, so they are 
better equipped to guide their patients along this challenging journey.

Lung Cancer Screening.

Lee E, Kazerooni EA.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and globally 
with the majority of lung cancer cases attributable to cigarette smoking. Given 
the high societal and personal cost of a diagnosis of lung cancer including that 
most cases of lung cancer when diagnosed are found at a late stage, work over 
the past 40 years has aimed to detect lung cancer earlier when curative 
treatment is possible. Screening trials using chest radiography and sputum 
failed to show a reduction in lung cancer mortality however multiple studies 
using low dose CT have shown the ability to detect lung cancer early and a 
survival benefit to those screened. This review will discuss the history of lung 
cancer screening, current recommendations and screening guidelines, and 
implementation and components of a lung cancer screening program.

Historically, the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with lung cancer has been 
bleak. However, the past 10 years have seen important advances in treatment and 
diagnosis which have translated into the first improvements seen in lung cancer 
survival. This review highlights the major advances in treatments with curative 
intent, systemic targeted therapies, palliative care and early diagnosis in lung 
cancer. We discuss the pivotal research that underpins these new 
technologies/strategies and their current position in clinical practice.

Lung cancer diagnosis is a challenge since it is also one of the most frequently 
diagnosed cancers. Diagnostic challenges are deeply related to the development 
of personalized therapy and molecular and precise histological characterizations 
of lung cancer. When addressing these features, it is very important to 
acknowledge the issue of tumour heterogeneity, as it imposes several questions. 
First of all, lung cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, at a cellular and 
histological level. Cellular and histological heterogeneity are addressed with 
emphasis on the diagnosis, pre-neoplastic lesions, and cell origin, trying to 
contribute to a better knowledge of carcinogenesis. Molecular intra-tumour and 
inter-tumour heterogeneity are also addressed as temporal heterogeneity. Lung 
cancer heterogeneity has implications in pathogenesis understanding, diagnosis, 
selection of tissue for molecular diagnosis, as well as therapeutic decision. 
The understanding of tumour heterogeneity is crucial and we must be aware of the 
implications and future developments regarding this field.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, 
with an average five-year survival rate of 15 percent. Smoking remains the 
predominant risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancers are categorized as small 
cell carcinoma or non-small cell carcinoma (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, large cell carcinoma). These categories are used for treatment 
decisions and determining prognosis. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on 
tumor type and extent of metastases. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with 
suspected lung cancer includes tissue diagnosis; a complete staging work-up, 
including evaluation of metastases; and a functional patient evaluation. 
Histologic diagnosis may be obtained with sputum cytology, thoracentesis, 
accessible lymph node biopsy, bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration, 
video-assisted thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy. Initial evaluation for metastatic 
disease relies on patient history and physical examination, laboratory tests, 
chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and tissue confirmation 
of mediastinal involvement. Further evaluation for metastases depends on the 
clinical presentation. Treatment and prognosis are closely tied to the type and 
stage of the tumor identified. For stages I through IIIA non-small cell 
carcinoma, surgical resection is preferred. Advanced non-small cell carcinoma is 
treated with a multimodality approach that may include radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy, and palliative care. Chemotherapy (combined with radiotherapy for 
limited disease) is the mainstay of treatment for small cell carcinoma. No major 
organization recommends screening for early detection of lung cancer, although 
screening has interested researchers and physicians. Smoking cessation remains 
the critical component of preventive primary care.

The recent development of imaging and sequencing technologies enables systematic 
advances in the clinical study of lung cancer. Meanwhile, the human mind is 
limited in effectively handling and fully utilizing the accumulation of such 
enormous amounts of data. Machine learning-based approaches play a critical role 
in integrating and analyzing these large and complex datasets, which have 
extensively characterized lung cancer through the use of different perspectives 
from these accrued data. In this review, we provide an overview of machine 
learning-based approaches that strengthen the varying aspects of lung cancer 
diagnosis and therapy, including early detection, auxiliary diagnosis, prognosis 
prediction, and immunotherapy practice. Moreover, we highlight the challenges 
and opportunities for future applications of machine learning in lung cancer.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the current status of lung cancer in China, 
including incidence, prevention, molecular testing and treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lung cancer presents a major public health issue and an 
enormous burden on society in China, because of its increasing incidence and 
high mortality. Several distinct gene profiles were associated with lung cancer 
in China: high EGFR mutation rate, low KRAS mutation rate and more comorbidity 
of HBV infection. Thus, local Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines 
with more consideration of drug accessibility, regional development differences 
were highly recommended for clinical practice. For treatment, targeted therapy 
has achieved fruitful progress. Immunotherapy in China was a little bit lag 
behind previously and now there is a surge of immunotherapeutic drugs under 
investigation. For future, more preventive strategies and more trials 
considering chrematistics of Chinese lung cancer are needed.
SUMMARY: There are achievements and shortcomings for lung cancer prevention and 
treatment in China. More work considering distinct characteristic of lung caner 
in China are needed.

Lung cancer has been transformed from a rare disease into a global problem and 
public health issue. The etiologic factors of lung cancer become more complex 
along with industrialization, urbanization, and environmental pollution around 
the world. Currently, the control of lung cancer has attracted worldwide 
attention. Studies on the epidemiologic characteristics of lung cancer and its 
relative risk factors have played an important role in the tertiary prevention 
of lung cancer and in exploring new ways of diagnosis and treatment. This 
article reviews the current evolution of the epidemiology of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the second and third most common cancer in Iceland for females 
and males, respectively. Although the incidence is declining, lung cancer still 
has the highest mortality of all cancers in Iceland. Symptoms of lung cancer can 
be specific and localized to the lungs, but more commonly they are unspecific 
and result in significant diagnostic delay. Therefore, majority of lung cancer 
patients are diagnosed with non-localized disease. In recent years, major 
developments have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. 
Positive emission scanning (PET) and both transbroncial (EBUS) or 
transesophageal ultrasound (EUS) biopsy techniques have resulted in improved 
mediastinal staging of the disease and minimal invasive video-assisted thoracic 
surgery (VATS) has lowered postoperative complications and shortened hospital 
stay. Technical developments in radiotherapy have benefitted those patients who 
are not candidates for curative surgery. Finally, and most importantly, recent 
advances in targeted chemotherapeutics and development of immunomodulating 
agents have made individual tailoring of treatment possible. Recent 
screening-trials with low-dose computed tomography show promising results in 
lowering mortality. This evidence-based review focuses on the most important 
developments in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, and includes 
Icelandic studies in the field.

Lung cancer is a complex disease composed of diverse histological and molecular 
types with clinical relevance. The advent of large-scale molecular profiling has 
been helpful to identify novel molecular targets that can be applied to the 
treatment of particular lung cancer patients and has helped to reshape the 
pathological classification of lung cancer. Novel directions include the 
immunotherapy revolution, which has opened the door for new opportunities for 
cancer therapy and is also redefining the classification of multiple tumors, 
including lung cancer. In the present chapter, we will review the main current 
basis of the pathological diagnosis and classification of lung cancer 
incorporating the histopathological and molecular dimensions of the disease.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death and the second most 
diagnosed cancer in the United States. Surgical intervention is most applicable 
to early-stage lung cancer diagnoses and considered the best curative option. 
Multiple surgical techniques are now available, including wedge resection, 
segmentectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy. Robotics and video-assistance are 
commonly used in wedge resection and sometimes used for segmentectomy. 
Regardless of the technique, focused clinical management of the patient 
following lung cancer surgery by nurses and nurse practitioners remains a 
priority. Future innovations affecting the surgical treatment of lung cancer 
include immunotherapy and oncogenomics.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung cancer is emerging as a leading cause of death in 
HIV-infected persons. This review will discuss the latest scientific evidence 
regarding the mechanisms driving lung cancer risk in HIV infection, the clinical 
presentation of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons and recent data regarding 
the outcomes, treatment and prevention of lung cancer in this group.
RECENT FINDINGS: Increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons is 
primarily due to higher smoking rates, but emerging evidence also implicates 
immunosuppression and inflammatory processes. Lung cancer outcomes may be worse 
in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral era, but this may stem, in part, 
from treatment disparities. Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed 
tomography (CT) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general 
population, and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in 
HIV-infected smokers.
SUMMARY: Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV 
infection. It is associated with unique HIV-related causal mechanisms, and may 
be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV-infected persons. Smoking 
cessation and early cancer detection with chest CT are likely to benefit 
HIV-infected smokers.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, less 
than 7% of patients survive 10 years following diagnosis across all stages of 
lung cancer. Late stage of diagnosis and lack of effective and personalized 
medicine reflect the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that 
underlie lung cancer progression. Quantitative proteomics provides the relative 
different protein abundance in normal and cancer patients which offers the 
information for molecular interactions, signaling pathways, and biomarker 
identification. Here we introduce both theoretical and practical applications in 
the use of quantitative proteomics approaches, with principles of current 
technologies and methodologies including gel-based, label free, stable isotope 
labeling as well as targeted proteomics. Predictive markers of drug resistance, 
candidate biomarkers for diagnosis, and prognostic markers in lung cancer have 
also been discovered and analyzed by quantitative proteomic analysis. Moreover, 
construction of protein networks enables to provide an opportunity to interpret 
disease pathway and improve our understanding in cancer therapeutic strategies, 
allowing the discovery of molecular markers and new therapeutic targets for lung 
cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Since tobacco 
smoking is the cause in vast majority of cases, the incidence of lung cancer is 
expected to rise in those countries with high or rising incidence of tobacco 
smoking. Even though populations at risk of developing lung cancer are easily 
identified, mass screening for lung cancer is not supported by currently 
available evidence. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, a cure may be 
possible with surgical resection followed by post-operative chemotherapy in 
those diagnosed at an early stage. A small minority of patients who present with 
locally advanced disease may also benefit from pre-operative chemotherapy and/or 
radiation therapy to down stage the tumor to render it potentially operable. In 
a vast majority of patients, however, lung cancer presents at an advanced stage 
and a cure is not possible with currently available therapeutic strategies. 
Similarly, small cell lung cancer confined to one hemi-thorax may be curable 
with a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation followed by 
prophylactic cranial irradiation, if complete remission is achieved at the 
primary site. Small cell lung cancer that is spread beyond the confines of one 
hemi-thorax is, however, considered incurable. In this era of molecular targeted 
therapies, new agents are constantly undergoing pre-clinical and clinical 
testing with the aim of targeting the molecular pathways thought be involved in 
etiology and pathogenesis of lung cancer.

address: agpallis@gmail.com.

It is estimated that approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases are observed in 
never-smokers and its incidence is expected to increase due to smoking 
prevention programs. Risk factors for the development of lung cancer described 
include second-hand smoking, radon exposure, occupational exposure to 
carcinogens and to cooking oil fumes and indoor coal burning. Other factors 
reported are infections (HPV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), hormonal and 
diatery factors and diabetes mellitus. Having an affected relative also 
increases the risk for lung cancer while recent studies have identified several 
single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk for lung cancer 
development in never smokers. Distinct clinical, pathology and molecular 
characteristics are observed in lung cancer in never smokers; more frequently is 
observed in females and adenocarcinoma is the predominant histology while it has 
a different pattern of molecular alterations. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize our current knowledge of this disease.

Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. 
Conventional treatments are not effective for metastatic lung cancer therapy. 
Although some of molecular targets have been identified with favorable response, 
those targets cannot be exploited due to the lack of suitable drug carriers. 
Lung cancer cell-derived exosomes (LCCDEs) receive recent interest in its role 
in carcinogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of lung cancer due to its 
biological functions and natural ability to carry donor cell biomolecules. 
LCCDEs can promote cell proliferation and metastasis, affect angiogenesis, 
modulate antitumor immune responses during lung cancer carcinogenesis, regulate 
drug resistance in lung cancer therapy, and be now considered an important 
component in liquid biopsy assessments for detecting lung cancer. Therapeutic 
deliverable exosomes are emerging as promising drug delivery agents specifically 
to tumor high precision medicine because of their natural intercellular 
communication role, excellent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, low 
toxicity, long blood circulation ability, biodegradable characteristics, and 
their ability to cross various biological barriers. Several studies are 
currently underway to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic modalities using 
LCCDEs, and to develop methods of exploiting exosomes for use as efficient drug 
delivery vehicles. Current status of lung cancer and extensive applicability of 
LCCDEs are illustrated in this review. The promising data and technologies 
indicate that the approach on LCCDEs implies the potential application of LCCDEs 
to clinical management of lung cancer patients.

Women and lung cancer: what is new?

General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

In the last 20 years, there has been an increased focus on gender differences in 
health and disease. The earliest studies of lung cancer enrolled mainly men, as 
the incidence of lung cancer among women was exceedingly low. As social patterns 
changed around World War II and women began to smoke more, the epidemiology of 
lung cancer has changed. The higher percentage of lung cancer in nonsmoking 
women as compared with nonsmoking men suggests that lung cancer behaves 
differently in women. Studies of lung cancer in women indicate that there are 
differences in risk factors, histology, pathophysiology, treatment outcomes, and 
prognosis as compared with men. The purpose of this review is to provide a 
concise summary of the literature on lung cancer as it pertains to women, with 
an emphasis on new areas of research and treatment options.

Adenocarcinoma has become the most prevalent lung cancer sub-type and its 
frequency is increasing. The earliest stages in the development of lung 
adenocarcinomas are visible using modern computed tomography (CT) as ground 
glass nodules. These pre-invasive nodules can progress over time to become 
invasive lung adenocarcinomas. Lesions in this developmental pathway are termed 
'adenocarcinoma spectrum' lesions. With the introduction of lung cancer 
screening programs there has been an increase in the detection of these lesions 
raising questions about natural history, surveillance and treatment. Here we 
review how the radiological appearance of an adenocarcinoma spectrum lesion 
relates to its underlying pathology and explore the natural history and factors 
driving lesion progression. We examine the molecular changes that occur at each 
stage of adenocarcinoma spectrum lesion development, including the effects of 
the driver mutations, EGFR and KRAS, that are key to invasive adenocarcinoma 
pathology. A better understanding of the development of pre-invasive disease 
will create treatment targets. Our understanding of how tumours interact with 
the immune system has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies. We 
review the role of the immune system in the development of adenocarcinoma 
spectrum lesions. With a clear preinvasive phase there is an opportunity to 
treat early adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions before an invasive lung cancer 
develops. We review current management including surveillance, surgical 
resection and oncological therapy as well as exploring potential future 
treatment avenues.

Lung cancer.

Rodescu D.

Only patients with localized lung cancer benefit from curative resection. 
Curative radiotherapy is recommended in patients with a resectable tumor in whom 
surgery is precluded for medical reasons. Adjuvant preoperative or postoperative 
therapy of any type does not improve the results of surgery except in patients 
with Pancoast tumor. Therapy for nonlocalized tumors does not affect survival. 
Radiotherapy has a palliative effect in 50 to 75 per cent of patients presenting 
with symptoms from either a primary lesion or metastases and should therefore be 
recommended in symptomatic patients. The palliative effect of chemotherapy is 
limited in lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas. However, chemotherapy 
alone or in association with radiotherapy produces remarkable tumor regression 
and some improvement of survival in small cell carcinoma. The use of 
immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer is still under evaluation.

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death globally. Delayed 
diagnosis is a major contributing factor to poor outcomes and remains a key 
challenge to overcome. While debate around the implementation of lung cancer 
screening for asymptomatic high-risk individuals continues, rapid access to 
relevant diagnostic tests is essential. The new National Optimal Lung Cancer 
Pathway describes 'diagnostic standards of care' in an effort to implement best 
practice, reduce variation and improve delays in diagnosis, staging and 
treatment of lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment continues to develop with new 
surgical techniques, radiotherapy options and more drugs being licensed as part 
of standard treatment. We provide an overview of the core lung cancer diagnostic 
steps, recognition and management of acute presentations as well as the latest 
treatment options.

Lung cancer needs to be considered in patients with a history of cigarette 
smoking and/or symptoms such as haemoptysis or non-resolving cough. Radiological 
investigations are useful in staging, but a tissue diagnosis is necessary to 
confirm the presence of a tumour. Although early detection and referral are 
important to achieve the best chance of a cure, primary prevention by smoking 
cessation is the most important measure.

During the 20th century, a dramatic epidemic of lung cancer deaths has occurred 
in many countries. The time trends of lung cancer incidence and mortality 
primarily reflect patterns of cigarette smoking, the predominant risk factor, 
but inconsistencies are evident in international comparisons. Although the 
predominant role of tobacco smoking as a cause of lung cancer throughout the 
world is amply documented, the persistence of tobacco smoking and the continued 
penetration of manufactured cigarettes into new markets provide a strong reason 
for continuing to monitor lung cancer trends. Changes in other risk factors for 
lung cancer and changes in diagnostic and death certificate reporting practices 
may also affect trends in rates. However, our understanding of the relationship 
between smoking and lung cancer allows forecasting of lung cancer rates for 
public health planning.

Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive form of cancer. Previously, surgery was 
rarely considered because most patients present at the advanced stages of the 
disease. New research and the advances in medical imaging has challenged this 
notion proving that, as part of a multimodal treatment pathway, surgery has a 
key role to play in the management of patients with early small cell lung 
cancer. In this chapter, we present the most pertinent research that has shaped 
clinical practice and outline the current treatment algorithm for small cell 
lung cancer.

Cytopathology has emerged as a promising platform in precision oncology 
especially after the revolutionary change in our understanding of the concept of 
lung cancer etiopathogenesis. With increasing use of minimally invasive 
techniques for sample acquisition, it becomes almost mandatory to utilize 
precious cytology samples maximally and judiciously by appropriate triaging of 
the specimen and timely action of the cytopathology team. Existing patient 
management protocols require accurate morphologic and molecular diagnosis of the 
lung cancer specimens which needs knowledge about evolving techniques related to 
specimen procurement, updates of genomic variants of lung cancer and recently 
developed molecular testing platforms and algorithms which are capable enough to 
use even miniscule amount of diagnostic material. This review provides a brief 
knowledge about advances in cytology of lung cancer which are helpful for 
developing correct clinical management strategies.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Iceland and the most frequent 
cause of cancer related deaths. Smoking is by far the most important cause but 
familial factors also contribute. The symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle 
and the diagnosis, in about 70% of cases, is made when metastases have occurred. 
Curative surgical treatment is therefore only possible in about a third of the 
cases whereas other patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In 
recent years some important advances have been made in the diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches to lung cancer. New imaging techniques have improved 
diagnosis and staging practices and consequently also treatment. Recent evidence 
suggests that screening with low dose CT may improve survival. New approaches to 
chemotherapy have been shown to improve survival and well being of patients with 
advanced disease. Chemotherapeutic agents are now being used in conjunction with 
surgery to reduce the risk of tumour spread. Furthermore, advances in surgical 
techniques have made resections possible in cases deemed inoperable in the past. 
In this review we present important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of 
lung cancer as reflected by recent literature that should be of interest to a 
wide variety of specialists.

Lung cancer - dia nosis and early detection.

[Article in English]

Decisions about the treatment of a patient with lung cancer depend on the 
clinical stage of the disease, morphological diagnosis, examination of 
predictive markers and overall clinical condition; the wishes of a well-informed 
patient must also be taken into account. Accurate diagnosis is essential for the 
future of a patient with lung cancer. The epidemiology of lung cancer is related 
to cigarette consumption. The risk of the disease increases with the number of 
cigarettes smoked. The relative risk for smokers is 22.4, for very heavy smokers 
with a load of more than 25 packets, it can reach up to 50. Most cases of lung 
cancer are caught in the advanced stages of the disease, when surgery and 
sometimes other active treatments are no longer possible. Searching for lung 
cancer in at-risk groups is essential for reducing lung cancer mortality, 
leading to the detection of the disease at a low stage when the tumor is 
operable.

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 13-20% of all lung cancers but is the 
fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. SCLC prognosis remains poor 
despite improvements in diagnosis and therapy over the last 30 years. Current 
treatment is systemic chemotherapy, flanked by thoracic irradiation for limited 
stage disease; however, about two-thirds of patients are diagnosed with 
extensive stage disease when thoracic irradiation is not worthwhile. Randomized 
trials on surgical resection in patients with limited stage disease conducted in 
the pre-PET era, when both staging and treatment were inadequate, did not 
support a role for surgery in disease management. However recent retrospective 
and population-based studies indicate that outcomes after surgery in patients 
with very early SCLC are comparable to those in patients with non-SCLC, and that 
survival is better than in SCLC patients not given surgery. CT screening 
identifies SCLC at an earlier stage - with better survival - than usual care, 
and offers the hope that more SCLC patients may become long-term survivors. 
However, cases must be exhaustively staged to identify those likely to benefit 
from surgery. Finding a specific SCLC marker to facilitate early diagnosis 
remains a priority.

The identification of targetable genomic alterations in lung cancer is required 
as standard of care to guide optimal therapy selection. With a constantly 
evolving landscape of ancillary molecular and biomarker testing in lung cancer, 
pathologists need to be aware of what specimens to test, how the testing should 
be performed, and which targets to test for to provide the clinically relevant 
genomic information necessary to treat these patients. Several guideline 
statements on the topic are currently available to help pathologists and 
laboratory personnel best use the small specimens obtained from patients with 
lung cancer for ancillary molecular testing.

BACKGROUND: The advances in the lung cancer screening methods and therapeutics, 
together with awareness towards deleterious habits, such as smoking, is 
increasing the overall survival with better quality of life for the patients. 
However, lung cancer is still one of the most common and fatal neoplasm with a 
high incidence and consequently burden to public health worldwide. Thus, based 
on guidelines and recent phases II and III clinical trials studies, this 
manuscript summarizes the current treatment sequencing strategies in lung 
cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of related articles was performed focused on 
phases II and III clinical trials studies.
RESULTS: The lung cancer management should take into consideration the tumor 
characteristics, histology, molecular pathology and be discussed in a 
multidisciplinary team. Lung cancer treatment options comprises surgery whenever 
possible, radiotherapy associate with/or chemotherapy and immunotherapy as 
monotherapy, or combined with chemotherapy and best palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: The screening predictability in more patients, smoking reduction, 
early diagnosis, better disease understanding and individualized, more effective 
and tolerable therapeutics are related to an increasing in overall survival and 
quality of life. In the near future improvement of personalized therapy in 
precision medicine is expected, enhancing new predictive biomarkers, optimal 
doses and optimal treatment sequencing as well as anti-cancer vaccines 
development.

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is the seventh leading cause of death among 
solid tumors. The main risk factor for lung cancer is smoking; however, 
approximately 15% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. LCINS is more 
frequent in women, irrespective of geographical location, nevertheless, the 
highest incidence has been found in South-East Asia. The histological incidence 
of adenocarcinoma is higher in the group of never smokers than squamous cell 
carcinoma. There is a familial clustering of lung cancer that is more pronounced 
in never smokers, where the family history was associated with an increased 
risk. Genome-wide association studies identified certain chromosomal aberrations 
in LCINS. Furthermore, the oncogenic mutation pattern is distinct in nonsmoking 
patients: activating mutations of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase are more 
frequent. The etiology of LCINS includes several environmental factors as well, 
such as environmental tobacco smoke, viral and hormonal factors, a variety of 
pulmonary diseases and certain occupational exposures. It is now established 
that EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (erlotinib and geftinib) in lung 
cancer is more effective in LCINS, owing to the higher incidence of EGFR 
mutation in nonsmokers. Despite the growing body of information on LCINS in 
recent years there is a need to further investigate the pathogenesis of this 
particular lung cancer. Future studies on LCINS should try to tackle the issues 
of prevention, early diagnosis and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets 
to combat lung cancer disease.

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) represents a growing and distinct entity 
within the broader landscape of lung malignancies. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of LCINS, encompassing its epidemiologic trends, risk 
factors, distinct genomic alterations, clinical outcomes and the ongoing 
initiative aimed at formulating screening guidelines tailored to this unique 
population. As LCINS continues to gain prominence, understanding its intricate 
genomic landscape has become pivotal for tailoring effective therapeutic 
strategies. Moreover, LCINS does not meet the criteria for lung cancer screening 
as per the current guidelines. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore its 
heterogeneity in order to devise optimal screening guidelines conducive to 
early-stage detection. This review underscores the vital importance of detailed 
research to elucidate the multifaceted nature of LCINS, with the potential to 
shape future clinical management and screening recommendations for this unique 
and growing patient cohort.

Female lung cancer.

Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 
and 1991. In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading 
cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The lung cancer epidemic is 
primarily attributable to cigarette smoking, which is responsible for at least 
80% of the disease in women. There are gender differences in the distribution of 
lung cancer by histologic type, even controlling for smoking, and some data 
suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level 
of smoking. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung 
cancer in nonsmoking women. Family history of lung cancer, personal history of 
lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), and 
a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk. Data 
specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific 
occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent. 
Finally, many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in 
individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables; however, clinical 
trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta-carotene supplementation. 
Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in 
women, efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to 
encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for 
reducing the female lung cancer burden.

The main purpose of tumor classification is to distinguish clear differences 
such as deciding treatment or showing a peculiar characteristic. In the 
treatment of lung cancer, the standard for treatment selection is to make the 
important classification of small cell lung cancer(SCLC)and non-small cell lung 
cancer(NSCLC). This is based on the fact that with a clinical-pathology 
difference and treatment reactivity, the prognosis differs between SCLC and 
NSCLC. In the 21st century, it has become insufficient to choose a treatment 
only by the classification of NSCLC with the advent of gefitinib a molecular 
target drug. Thus, treatment must be chosen in terms of the presence or absence 
of adenocarcinoma, an ethnic group, gender, a smoking history, and also the gene 
mutation. Moreover, it was reported by ASCO in 2008 that efficacy of pemetrexed 
is low for non-squamous cell carcinoma. From now on, not the NSCLC 
classification, but further detailed classification is needed to choose a 
treatment. Treatment selection in terms of the individual will be possible with 
ongoing study.

INTRODUCTION: Proteins are molecules that have role in the progression of the 
diseases. Proteomics is a tool that can play an effective role in identifying 
diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for lung cancer. Cytokines are proteins 
that play a decisive role in activating body's immune system in lung cancer. 
They can increase the growth of the tumor (oncogenic cytokines) or limit tumor 
growth (anti-tumor cytokines) by regulating related signaling pathways such as 
proliferation, growth, metastasis, and apoptosis.
AREAS COVERED: In the present study, a total of 223 papers including 196 
research papers and 27 review papers, extracted from PubMed and Scopus and 
published from 1997 to present, are reviewed. The most important 
involved-cytokines in lung cancer including TNF-α, IFN- γ, TGF-β, VEGF and 
interleukins such as IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, IL-10, IL-22, IL-1β and IL-18 are 
introduced. Also, the pathological and biological role of such cytokines in 
cancer signaling pathways is explained.
EXPERT OPINION: In lung cancer, the cytokine expression changes under the 
physiological conditions of the immune system, and inflammatory cytokines are 
associated with the progression of lung cancer. Therefore, the cytokine 
expression profile can be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of 
therapeutic responses, and survival of patients with lung cancer.
