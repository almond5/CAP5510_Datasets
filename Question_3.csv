In the United States, lung cancer is the second most common diagnosed cancer and 
the leading cause of cancer-related death. Though tobacco smoking is the major 
risk factor accounting for 80 to 90% of all lung cancer diagnoses, there are 
numerous other risk factors that have been identified as casually associated 
with lung cancer etiology. However, there are few causally-linked risk factors 
for lung cancer diagnosed among never smokers which, if considered a unique 
reportable category, is the 11th most common cancer and the 7th leading cause of 
cancer-related death. Lung cancer survival has only marginally improved over the 
last several decades, but the availability of screening and early detection by 
low-dose computer tomography and advances in targeted treatments and 
immunotherapy will likely decrease mortality rates and improve patient survival 
outcomes in the near future.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in North America and 
other developed countries. One of the reasons lung cancer is at the top of the 
list is that it is often not diagnosed until the cancer is at an advanced stage. 
Thus, the earliest diagnosis of lung cancer is crucial, especially in screening 
high-risk populations, such as smokers, exposure to fumes, oil fields, toxic 
occupational places, etc. Based on the current knowledge, it looks that there is 
an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers. The current diagnosis of lung 
cancer includes different types of imaging complemented with pathological 
assessment of biopsies, but these techniques can still not detect early lung 
cancer developments. In this review, we described the advantages and 
disadvantages of current methods used in diagnosing lung cancer, and we provide 
an analysis of the potential use of body fluids as carriers of biomarkers as 
predictors of cancer development and progression.

Historically, the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with lung cancer has been 
bleak. However, the past 10 years have seen important advances in treatment and 
diagnosis which have translated into the first improvements seen in lung cancer 
survival. This review highlights the major advances in treatments with curative 
intent, systemic targeted therapies, palliative care and early diagnosis in lung 
cancer. We discuss the pivotal research that underpins these new 
technologies/strategies and their current position in clinical practice.

Lung Cancer Screening.

Lee E, Kazerooni EA.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and globally 
with the majority of lung cancer cases attributable to cigarette smoking. Given 
the high societal and personal cost of a diagnosis of lung cancer including that 
most cases of lung cancer when diagnosed are found at a late stage, work over 
the past 40 years has aimed to detect lung cancer earlier when curative 
treatment is possible. Screening trials using chest radiography and sputum 
failed to show a reduction in lung cancer mortality however multiple studies 
using low dose CT have shown the ability to detect lung cancer early and a 
survival benefit to those screened. This review will discuss the history of lung 
cancer screening, current recommendations and screening guidelines, and 
implementation and components of a lung cancer screening program.

Lung Cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States 
and Worldwide. Incidence and mortality have been on the decline in the United 
States, while worldwide cases continue to increase. Risk factor modification and 
screening are critical to improving survival in patients with lung cancer. 
Identifying at-risk populations for access to care and screening programs will 
improve overall outcomes. Understanding environmental and carcinogenic sources 
are integral to public health policy and education. Innovations in population 
health and translational research will be essential in the future to improve 
lung cancer survival.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, 
with an average five-year survival rate of 15 percent. Smoking remains the 
predominant risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancers are categorized as small 
cell carcinoma or non-small cell carcinoma (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, large cell carcinoma). These categories are used for treatment 
decisions and determining prognosis. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on 
tumor type and extent of metastases. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with 
suspected lung cancer includes tissue diagnosis; a complete staging work-up, 
including evaluation of metastases; and a functional patient evaluation. 
Histologic diagnosis may be obtained with sputum cytology, thoracentesis, 
accessible lymph node biopsy, bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration, 
video-assisted thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy. Initial evaluation for metastatic 
disease relies on patient history and physical examination, laboratory tests, 
chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and tissue confirmation 
of mediastinal involvement. Further evaluation for metastases depends on the 
clinical presentation. Treatment and prognosis are closely tied to the type and 
stage of the tumor identified. For stages I through IIIA non-small cell 
carcinoma, surgical resection is preferred. Advanced non-small cell carcinoma is 
treated with a multimodality approach that may include radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy, and palliative care. Chemotherapy (combined with radiotherapy for 
limited disease) is the mainstay of treatment for small cell carcinoma. No major 
organization recommends screening for early detection of lung cancer, although 
screening has interested researchers and physicians. Smoking cessation remains 
the critical component of preventive primary care.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that includes 
research in robotics, language recognition, image recognition, natural language 
processing, and expert systems. AI is poised to change medical practice, and 
oncology is not an exception to this trend. As the matter of fact, lung cancer 
has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. The leading cause is the 
complexity of associating early pulmonary nodules with neoplastic changes and 
numerous factors leading to strenuous treatment choice and poor prognosis. AI 
can effectively enhance the diagnostic efficiency of lung cancer while providing 
optimal treatment and evaluating prognosis, thereby reducing mortality. This 
review seeks to provide an overview of AI relevant to all the fields of lung 
cancer. We define the core concepts of AI and cover the basics of the 
functioning of natural language processing, image recognition, human-computer 
interaction and machine learning. We also discuss the most recent breakthroughs 
in AI technologies and their clinical application regarding diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis in lung cancer. Finally, we highlight the future 
challenges of AI in lung cancer and its impact on medical practice.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Lung 
cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to 
reduce lung cancer specific mortality. In 2013, the United States Preventive 
Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual lung cancer screening with LDCT 
for smokers aged between 55 years to 80 years, with at least 30 pack-years of 
smoking exposure that currently smoke or who have quit smoking within 15 years. 
Risk-based lung cancer screening is an alternative approach that defines 
screening eligibility based on the personal risk of individuals. Selection of 
individuals for lung cancer screening based on their personal lung cancer risk 
has been shown to improve the sensitivity and specificity associated with the 
eligibility criteria of the screening program as compared to the 2013 USPSTF 
criteria. Numerous risk prediction models have been developed to estimate the 
lung cancer risk of individuals incorporating sociodemographic, smoking, and 
clinical risk factors associated with lung cancer, including age, smoking 
history, sex, race/ethnicity, personal and family history of cancer, and history 
of emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among others. 
Some risk prediction models include biomarker information, such as germline 
mutations or protein-based biomarkers as independent risk predictors, in 
addition to clinical, smoking, and sociodemographic risk factors. While, the 
majority of lung cancer risk prediction models are suitable for selecting 
high-risk individuals for lung cancer screening, some risk models have been 
developed to predict the probability of malignancy of screen-detected solidary 
pulmonary nodules or to optimize the screening frequency of eligible individuals 
by incorporating past screening findings. In this systematic review, we provide 
an overview of existing risk prediction models and their applications to lung 
cancer screening. We discuss potential strengths and limitations of lung cancer 
screening using risk prediction models and future research directions.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung cancer is emerging as a leading cause of death in 
HIV-infected persons. This review will discuss the latest scientific evidence 
regarding the mechanisms driving lung cancer risk in HIV infection, the clinical 
presentation of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons and recent data regarding 
the outcomes, treatment and prevention of lung cancer in this group.
RECENT FINDINGS: Increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons is 
primarily due to higher smoking rates, but emerging evidence also implicates 
immunosuppression and inflammatory processes. Lung cancer outcomes may be worse 
in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral era, but this may stem, in part, 
from treatment disparities. Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed 
tomography (CT) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general 
population, and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in 
HIV-infected smokers.
SUMMARY: Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV 
infection. It is associated with unique HIV-related causal mechanisms, and may 
be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV-infected persons. Smoking 
cessation and early cancer detection with chest CT are likely to benefit 
HIV-infected smokers.

Lung cancer is one of the most common diseases among humans and one of the major 
causes of growing mortality. Medical experts believe that diagnosing lung cancer 
in the early phase can reduce death with the illustration of lung nodule through 
computed tomography (CT) screening. Examining the vast amount of CT images can 
reduce the risk. However, the CT scan images incorporate a tremendous amount of 
information about nodules, and with an increasing number of images make their 
accurate assessment very challenging tasks for radiologists. Recently, various 
methods are evolved based on handcraft and learned approach to assist 
radiologists. In this paper, we reviewed different promising approaches 
developed in the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to detect and classify 
the nodule through the analysis of CT images to provide radiologists' assistance 
and present the comprehensive analysis of different methods.

Many studies have proved that the pathogenesis of the chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer is related, and may cause and affect 
each other to a certain extent. In fact, the change of chronic airway 
obstruction will continue to have an impact on the screening, treatment, and 
prognosis of lung cancer.In this comprehensive review, we outlined the links and 
heterogeneity between COPD and lung cancer and finds that factors such as gene 
expression and genetic susceptibility, epigenetics, smoking, epithelial 
mesenchymal transformation (EMT), chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress 
injury may all play a role in the process. Although the relationship between 
these two diseases have been largely determined, the methods to prevent lung 
cancer in COPD patients are still limited. Early diagnosis is still the key to a 
better prognosis. Thus, it is necessary to establish more intuitive screening 
evaluation criteria and find suitable biomarkers for lung cancer screening in 
high-risk populations with COPD. Some studies have indicated that COPD may 
change the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy by affecting the response of lung 
cancer patients to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). And for lung cancer 
patients with COPD, the standardized management of COPD can improve the 
prognosis. The treatment of lung cancer patients with COPD is an individualized, 
comprehensive, and precise process. The development of new targets and new 
strategies of molecular targeted therapy may be the breakthrough for disease 
treatment in the future.

The prognosis of lung cancer patients with different clinical stages is 
significantly different. The 5-year survival of stage IA groups can exceed 90%, 
while patients with stage IV can be less than 10%. Therefore, early diagnosis is 
extremely important for lung cancer patients. This research focused on various 
diagnosis methods of early lung cancer, including imaging screening, 
bronchoscopy, and emerging potential liquid biopsies, as well as volatile 
organic compounds, autoantibodies, aiming to improve the early diagnosis rate 
and explore feasible and effective early diagnosis strategies.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women in the United 
States; however, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in the 
United States and worldwide. The most common but nonspecific symptom of lung 
cancer is cough. Associated symptoms, including hemoptysis or shortness of 
breath, or systemic symptoms, including anorexia or weight loss, greatly 
increase the likelihood of having lung cancer. Referral to a multidisciplinary 
lung cancer team, imaging, and confirmation through sputum cytology, 
thoracentesis, fine-needle aspiration, or mediastinoscopy are recommended. If 
lung cancer is confirmed, treatment options vary based on staging, histology, 
immunotherapy biomarker testing, and patient health status. Treatments include 
surgical resection, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Family 
physicians should focus on primary prevention of lung cancer by encouraging 
tobacco cessation and early recognition by screening at-risk individuals and 
following guidelines for pulmonary nodules. As of 2021, the U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening using low-dose 
computed tomography starting at 50 years of age in patients with a 20 pack-year 
history.

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death globally. Delayed 
diagnosis is a major contributing factor to poor outcomes and remains a key 
challenge to overcome. While debate around the implementation of lung cancer 
screening for asymptomatic high-risk individuals continues, rapid access to 
relevant diagnostic tests is essential. The new National Optimal Lung Cancer 
Pathway describes 'diagnostic standards of care' in an effort to implement best 
practice, reduce variation and improve delays in diagnosis, staging and 
treatment of lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment continues to develop with new 
surgical techniques, radiotherapy options and more drugs being licensed as part 
of standard treatment. We provide an overview of the core lung cancer diagnostic 
steps, recognition and management of acute presentations as well as the latest 
treatment options.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. A major reason 
for poor prognosis is that patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage 
and thus there are limited options for curative treatment at the time of 
diagnosis. Early detection may improve lung cancer survival, as demonstrated in 
computed tomography screening studies. New and innovative bronchoscopic methods 
have been developed for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. High-precision 
bronchoscopic imaging technology, such as optical biopsy, may potentially 
replace traditional biopsy techniques. This article reviews the advanced 
technologies for detection of early lung cancer.

Lung cancer screening.

Sleep Medicine, Yale Cancer Center Thoracic Oncology Program, Yale School of 
Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomography 
is now recommended for high-risk individuals by the US Preventive Services Task 
Force. This recommendation was informed by several randomized controlled trials, 
the largest of which, the National Lung Screening Trial, demonstrated a 20% 
relative reduction in lung cancer mortality with annual low-dose chest computed 
tomography compared with chest radiography.
RECENT FINDINGS: The benefit of lung cancer screening must be balanced against 
potential harms, including a high false-positive rate with consequent further 
evaluative studies and invasive testing. It is critical that harms be minimized 
as screening generalizes to the broad community. Informed decision making 
between providers and patients should include individualized risk assessment, a 
discussion of both potential benefit and harm, and tobacco treatment. Given the 
multiple components required for high quality, screening should ideally occur in 
the context of a multidisciplinary program.
SUMMARY: We are in the early days of lung cancer screening, still with much to 
learn. Ongoing studies are necessary to refine the definition of a positive 
screen and develop better methods of distinguishing between true positive and 
false-positive results. Novel approaches, including the development of 
multicomponent lung cancer biomarkers, will likely inform and improve our future 
screening practice.

Early diagnosis of lung cancer is currently the most effective way of reducing 
lung cancer mortality other than quitting smoking because the treatment of late 
stage disease has little impact. Improving the awareness of the risk of lung 
cancer and warning symptoms, recognition and prompt referral, and screening with 
low dose computed tomography (LDCT) are potential ways to improve early 
diagnosis. Currently the evidence is strongest for LDCT, where one large trial, 
the US National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), showed a 20% relative reduction in 
lung cancer-related mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality in 
patients who had LDCT compared with chest X-ray. Although many questions remain 
about optimal methodology and cost-effectiveness, lung cancer screening is now 
being implemented in the USA using the NLST screening criteria. Many of these 
questions are being answered by on-going European trials that are reporting 
their findings. Here we review the research evidence for LDCT screening and 
explore the important issues that need to be addressed to optimise 
effectiveness.

The five-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is very low, mainly because 
most newly diagnosed patients present with locally advanced or metastatic 
disease. Therefore, early diagnosis is key to the successful treatment and 
management of lung cancer. Unfortunately, early detection methods of lung cancer 
are not ideal. In this brief review, we described early detection methods such 
as chest X-rays followed by bronchoscopy, sputum analysis followed by 
cytological analysis, and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). In addition, we 
discussed the potential of metabolomic fingerprinting, compared to that of other 
biomarkers, including molecular targets, as a low-cost, high-throughput 
blood-based test that is both feasible and affordable for early-stage lung 
cancer screening of at-risk populations. Accordingly, we proposed a paradigm 
shift to metabolomics as an alternative to molecular and proteomic-based markers 
in lung cancer screening, which will enable blood-based routine testing and be 
accessible to those patients at the highest risk for lung cancer.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The possibility of complete recovery for a lung cancer 
patient depends on very early diagnosis, as it allows total surgical resection. 
Screening for this cancer in a high-risk population can be performed using a 
radiological approach, but this holds a certain number of limitations. Liquid 
biopsy could become an alternative and complementary screening approach to chest 
imaging for early diagnosis of lung cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several circulating biomarkers indicative of lung cancer can be 
investigated in blood, such as circulating tumor cells, circulating free nucleic 
acids (RNA and DNA) and proteins. However, none of these biomarkers have yet 
been adopted in routine clinical practice and studies are ongoing to confirm or 
not the usefulness and practical interest in routine early diagnosis and 
screening for lung cancers.
SUMMARY: Several potential circulating biomarkers for the early detection of 
lung cancer exist. When coupled to thoracic imaging, these biomarkers must give 
diagnosis of a totally resectable lung cancer and potentially provide new 
recommendations for surveillance by imagery of high-risk populations without a 
detectable nodule. Optimization of the specificity and sensitivity of the 
detection methods as well as standardization of the techniques is essential 
before considering for daily practice a liquid biopsy as an early diagnostic 
tool, or possibly as a predictive test, of lung cancer.

Lung cancer remains the most significant cause of cancer death, accounting for 
about 20% of all cancer-related mortality. A significant reason for this is 
delayed diagnosis, either due to lack of symptoms in early-stage disease or 
presentation with non-specific symptoms common with a broad range of alternative 
diagnoses. More is needed in terms of increasing public awareness, providing 
adequate healthcare professional education and implementing clinical pathways 
that improve the earlier diagnosis of symptomatic lung cancer. Low-dose computed 
tomography screening of high-risk, asymptomatic populations has been shown to 
reduce lung cancer mortality, with focus now shifting towards how best to 
implement lung cancer screening on a wider scale in a safe, efficient and 
cost-effective manner. For maximum benefit, efforts must be made to optimise 
uptake, especially among high-risk populations with significant socioeconomic 
deprivation, as well as successfully incorporate tobacco-dependency treatment. 
Quality assured programme management will be critical to minimising 
screening-related harms and adequately managing incidental findings. By 
undertaking the above, there can be optimism that lung cancer outcomes can be 
improved significantly in the near future.

BACKGROUND: Most lung cancer patients are diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. 
However, whether the symptoms of lung cancer were independently associated with 
the diagnosis of lung cancer is unknown, especially in the Chinese population.
METHODS: We conducted a 10 years (2005-2014) nationwide multicenter 
retrospective clinical epidemiology study of lung cancer patients diagnosed in 
China. As such, this study focused on nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
calculated the odds ratios (ORs) for variables associated with the symptoms and 
physical signs using multivariate unconditional logistic regressions.
RESULTS: A total of 7184 lung cancer patients were surveyed; finally, 6398 NSCLC 
patients with available information about their symptoms and physical signs were 
included in this analysis. The most common initial symptom and physical sign was 
chronic cough (4156, 65.0%), followed by sputum with blood (2110, 33.0%), chest 
pain (1146, 17.9%), shortness of breath (1090, 17.0%), neck and supraclavicular 
lymphadenectasis (629, 9.8%), weight loss (529, 8.3%), metastases pain (378, 
5.9%), fatigue (307, 4.8%), fever (272, 4.3%), and dyspnea (270, 4.2%). Patients 
with squamous carcinoma and stage III disease were more likely to present with 
chronic cough (P < 0.0001) and sputum with blood (P < 0.0001) than patients with 
other pathological types and clinical stages, respectively. Metastases pain 
(P < 0.0001) and neck and supraclavicular lymphadenectasis (P = 0.0006) were 
more likely to occur in patients with nonsquamous carcinoma than in patients 
with other carcinomas. Additionally, patients with stage IV disease had a higher 
percentage of chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea, weight loss, and fatigue 
than patients with other stages of disease. In multivariable logistic analyses, 
compared with patients with adenocarcinoma, patients with squamous carcinoma 
were more likely to experience symptoms (OR = 2.885, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 2.477-3.359) but were less likely to present physical signs (OR = 0.844, 
95% CI 0.721-0.989). The odds of having both symptoms and physical signs were 
higher in patients with late-stage disease than in those with early-stage 
disease (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms and physical signs of lung cancer were associated with 
the stage and pathological diagnosis of NSCLC. Patients with squamous carcinoma 
were more likely to develop symptoms, but not signs, than patients with 
adenocarcinoma. The more advanced the stage at diagnosis, the more likely that 
symptoms or physical signs are to develop. Further prospective cohort studies 
are needed to explore these results.

The National Lung Screening Study has demonstrated that screening with low-dose 
spiral computed tomography results in fewer deaths from lung cancer compared 
with screening with chest radiography (CXR). Previous trials of screening with 
CXR and sputum cytology failed to exhibit fewer deaths compared with no 
screening intervention. Early computed tomography (CT) studies showed promise 
for CT to be a more sensitive test, yet were unable to demonstrate sufficient 
evidence of efficacy. This review examines the problem of early lung cancer 
detection, the issues presented by screening, and results of past and recent 
studies of lung cancer screening.

«Early lung cancer diagnosis among workers exposed to carcinogens». Following 
the publication of results of NLST (National Lung Screening Trial, USA) and 
ELCAP (Early Lung Cancer Action Project, USA), lung cancer screening with 
low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk subjects has been recommended 
in North-America. Conversely, the European Community has been waiting for 
further evidence. The recently concluded Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening 
trial (NELSON) confirmed the efficacy of LDCT screening in reducing lung cancer 
mortality. Two recent studies in the USA and Italy showed positive results in 
occupational settings among workers formerly exposed to asbestos. The available 
evidence seems to suggest the need to implement lung cancer screening programs 
among heavy smokers and workers substantively exposed to occupational 
carcinogens also in Europe, following common, standardized procedures, as 
indicated in a recent European position statement.

The purpose of this article is to review options for more rapid diagnosis of 
lung cancer at an earlier stage, thereby improving survival. These options 
include screening, allowing general practitioners to refer patients directly to 
low-dose computed tomography scan instead of a chest X-ray and the abolition of 
the ""visitation filter"", i.e. hospital doctors' ability to reject referrals from 
general practitioners without prior discussion with the referring doctor.

The goal of delivering personalized lung cancer screening is a worthy one. It is 
inspiring to envision a future in which screening decisions are informed by the 
best available evidence, tailored to an individual's specific characteristics, 
and consistent with their preferences and values. At the societal level, 
tradeoffs between effectiveness, efficiency and equity are inevitable and will 
need to be balanced exquisitely, with ample input from patients and other 
stakeholders. Tools such as the ENGAGE framework will continue to enlighten and 
to shape the ongoing conversation.

Lung cancer is a global health burden and is among the most common and deadliest 
of all malignancies worldwide. The goal of screening programs is to detect 
tumors in earlier, curable stages, consequently reducing disease-specific 
mortality. The issue of screening has great relevance to thoracic surgeons, who 
should play a leading role in the debate over screening and its consequences. 
The burden is on thoracic surgeons to work in a multidisciplinary setting to 
guide and treat these patients safely and responsibly, ensuring low morbidity 
and mortality of potential diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.

Computed tomography screening for the early detection of lung cancer.

Petersen RP(1), Harpole DH Jr.

Author information:

Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world 
and has an increased chance of cure if detected at an earlier stage, routine 
lung cancer screening is currently not recommended in the United States. 
Unfortunately, most patients with lung cancer present only after the onset of 
symptoms and have advanced disease that cannot be surgically resected. The 
overall 5-year survival rate for all patients with lung cancer is only 15%. When 
the cancer is detected at its earliest stage (pathologic stage IA), however, the 
5-year survival rate is more than 70%. Although past randomized screening trials 
evaluating the use of standard chest radiography or sputum cytology have not 
resulted in lower mortality, recent studies suggest that computed tomography 
(CT) may have promise as a screening tool. This article summarizes experience 
over the past decade of using low-dose spiral CT imaging as a screening tool to 
detect early lung cancers in asymptomatic, high-risk individuals.

The importance of screening for lung cancer.

Lung cancer is a major public health problem as it causes the most 
cancer-related deaths worldwide. As the disease often causes no symptoms at 
early stages, diagnosis at advanced stages, wherein cure is no longer possible, 
is common. Improvements in lung cancer treatment have been made, but yielded 
only modest improvement in survival over the last decades. Continuous efforts 
should be made to force back exposure to causative agents of lung cancer, 
tobacco smoking in particular. However, this is not expected to reverse the lung 
cancer epidemic in the next decades. Lung cancer screening can reduce morbidity 
and mortality by detecting lung cancer at an early and curable stage. Initial 
estimates of many harms and benefits of screening have been made, suggesting 
that the benefits of low-dose computed tomography screening outweigh the harms. 
Finally, the success of an implemented screening program is determined by the 
benefit it will yield for public health.

Decisions about the treatment of a patient with lung cancer depend on the 
clinical stage of the disease, morphological diagnosis, examination of 
predictive markers and overall clinical condition; the wishes of a well-informed 
patient must also be taken into account. Accurate diagnosis is essential for the 
future of a patient with lung cancer. The epidemiology of lung cancer is related 
to cigarette consumption. The risk of the disease increases with the number of 
cigarettes smoked. The relative risk for smokers is 22.4, for very heavy smokers 
with a load of more than 25 packets, it can reach up to 50. Most cases of lung 
cancer are caught in the advanced stages of the disease, when surgery and 
sometimes other active treatments are no longer possible. Searching for lung 
cancer in at-risk groups is essential for reducing lung cancer mortality, 
leading to the detection of the disease at a low stage when the tumor is 
operable.

The electronic nose (e-nose) is a promising technology as a useful addition to 
the currently available modalities to achieve lung cancer diagnosis. The e-nose 
can assess the volatile organic compounds detected in the breath and derived 
from the cellular metabolism. Volatile organic compounds can be analyzed to 
identify the individual chemical elements as well as their pattern of expression 
to reproduce a sensorial combination similar to a fingerprint (breathprint). The 
e-nose can be used alone, mimicking the combinatorial selectivity of the human 
olfactory system, or as part of a multisensorial platform. This review analyzes 
the progress made by investigators interested in this technology as well as the 
perspectives for its future utilization.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. As a result 
of the increasing use of chest CT scans and lung cancer screening initiatives, 
there is a rapidly increasing need for lung lesion analysis and - in case of 
confirmed cancer - treatment. A desirable future concept is the one-stop 
outpatient bronchoscopic approach including navigation to the tumor, malignancy 
confirmation and immediate treatment. Several novel bronchoscopic diagnostic and 
treatment concepts are currently under evaluation contributing to this concept. 
As the majority of suspected malignant lung lesions develop in the periphery of 
the lungs, improved bronchoscopic navigation to the target lesion is of key 
importance. Fortunately, the field of interventional pulmonology is evolving 
rapidly and several advanced bronchoscopic navigation techniques are clinically 
available, allowing an increasingly accurate tissue diagnosis of peripheral lung 
lesions. Additionally, multiple bronchoscopic treatment modalities are currently 
under investigation. This review will provide a concise overview of advanced 
bronchoscopic techniques to diagnose and treat peripheral lung cancer by 
describing their working mechanisms, strengths and weaknesses, identifying 
knowledge gaps and indicating future developments. The desired one-step concept 
of bronchoscopic 'diagnose and treat' peripheral lung cancer is on the horizon.

Significant advances in the management of both early and advanced stage lung 
cancer have not yet led to the scale of improved outcomes which have been 
achieved in other cancers over the last 40 years. Diagnosis of lung cancer at 
the earliest stage of disease is strongly associated with improved survival. 
Therefore, although recent advances in oncology may herald breakthroughs in 
effective treatment, achieving early diagnosis will remain crucial to obtaining 
optimal outcomes. This is challenging, as most lung cancer symptoms are 
non-specific or are common respiratory symptoms which usually represent benign 
disease. Identification of patients at risk of lung cancer who require further 
investigation is an important responsibility for general practitioners (GPs). 
Diagnosis has historically relied upon plain chest X-ray (CXR), organised in 
response to symptoms. The sensitivity of this modality, however, compares 
unfavourably with that of computed tomography (CT). In some jurisdictions 
screening high-risk individuals with low dose CT (LDCT) is now recommended. 
However uptake remains low and the eligibility for screening programmes is 
restricted. Therefore, even if screening is widely adopted, most patients will 
continue to be diagnosed after presenting with symptoms. Achieving early 
diagnosis requires GPs to maintain an appropriate level of suspicion and 
readiness to investigate in high-risk patients or those with non-resolving 
symptoms. This article discusses the early detection of lung cancer from a 
primary care perspective. We outline risk factors and epidemiology, the role of 
screening and offer guidance on the recognition of symptomatic presentation and 
the investigation and referral of suspected lung cancer.

In China, the malignant tumor with the highest incidence and motality is lung 
cancer (LC). As screening and early detection and treatment are effective in 
reducing LC mortality, formulating a guideline in line with China's national 
conditions for the screening and early detection and treatment of LC will 
greatly promote the homogeneity and accuracy of LC screening, and result in an 
improvement of the effectiveness of LC screening. Commissioned and directed by 
the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission of 
the People's Republic of China, the guidline was initiated by the National 
Cancer Center of China and formulated with joint effort by experts from 
different disciplines. Following the principles and methods in WHO Handbook for 
Guideline Development, the guidline integrates the latest development in LC 
screening and early diagnosis and treatment worldwide while fully considering 
China's national conditions and practical experience in LC screening. It 
provides detailed evidence-based recommendations for different aspects of LC 
screening, such as the targeted population, the technologies and the procedures, 
to regulate the practices of LC screening and early diagnosis and treatment and 
enhance the effectiveness of the prevention and control of LC in China.

BACKGROUND: Methylated genes detected in sputum are promise biomarkers for lung 
cancer. Yet the current PCR technologies for quantification of DNA methylation 
and diagnostic value of the sputum biomarkers are not sufficient to be used for 
lung cancer early detection. The emerging droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a 
straightforward means for precise, direct, and absolute quantification of 
nucleic acids. Here, we investigate whether ddPCR can sensitively and robustly 
quantify DNA methylation in sputum for more precise diagnosis of lung cancer.
RESULTS: First, the analytic performance of methylation-specific ddPCR (ddMSP) 
and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) is determined in methylated and 
unmethylated DNA samples. Second, 29 genes, previously proposed as potential 
sputum biomarkers for lung cancer, are analyzed by using ddMSP in a training set 
of 127 lung cancer patients and 159 controls. ddMSP has higher sensitivity, 
precision, and reproducibility for quantification of methylation compared with 
qMSP (all p < 0.05). A classifier comprising four sputum methylation biomarkers 
for lung cancer is developed by using ddMSP, producing 86.6% sensitivity and 
90.6% specificity, independent of stage and histology of lung cancer (all 
p > 0.05). The classifier has higher accuracy compared with sputum cytology 
(88.8 vs. 70.6%, p < 0.01). The diagnostic performance is confirmed in a testing 
set of 89 cases and 107 controls.
CONCLUSIONS: ddMSP is a robust tool for reliable quantification of DNA 
methylation in sputum, and the epigenetic classifier could help diagnose lung 
cancer at the early stage.

The early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Petty TL.

Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignancy in both men and women, both in 
the United States and elsewhere in the world. Today, lung cancer is most often 
diagnosed on the basis of symptoms of advanced disease or when chest x-rays are 
taken for a variety of purposes unrelated to lung cancer detection. 
Unfortunately, in the United States no society or governmental agency recommends 
screening, even for patients with high risks, such as smokers with airflow 
obstruction or people with occupational exposures, including asbestos. The 
origins of this negative attitude toward lung cancer screening are found in 3 
studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute in the mid-1970s and 
conducted at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the Mayo Clinic, and 
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center. These studies concluded that early 
identification of lung cancer through chest x-rays and cytologic diagnosis of 
sputum did not alter disease-specific mortality. However, patients with earlier 
stage disease were found through screening, which resulted in a higher 
resectability rate and improved survival in the screening group compared with a 
control group of patients receiving ordinary care. Patients in the control group 
often received annual chest x-rays during the course of this study, which was 
the standard of care at the time. Thus no true nonscreening control group 
resulted. The patients at highest risk were not enrolled in this study. No 
specific amount of pack-years of smoking intensity was required. Only men were 
screened. The studies were inadequately powered to show an improvement in 
mortality rate of less than 50%. Ninety percent of lung cancer occurs in 
smokers. The prevalence of lung cancer is 4 to 6 times greater when smokers have 
airflow obstruction than with normal airflow, when all other background factors, 
including smoking history, occupational risk, and family history, are the same. 
Screening heavy smokers (ie, > or = 30 pack-years) with airflow obstruction 
(forced expiratory volume in one second < 70% of normal) will yield 2% or more 
patients with lung cancer (prevalence cases) and, over the course of 5 years, 
probably from 2% to 3% of patients with additional cancers, yielding an overall 
incidence of 5%. New technologies include low-dose helical computed tomographic 
scans for small peripheral adenocarcinomas that cannot yet be visualized by 
standard chest x-rays and cytologic diagnosis of sputum for central squamous 
cell lesions. These tests are complementary. A new health care initiative, the 
National Lung Health Education Program, recommends spirometric testing for all 
smokers 45 years or older, as well as for patients with symptoms of lung cancer. 
Screening for lung cancer in such patients will find many cancers at an early 
stage when they are amenable to cure. Today, we have the knowledge and the 
technology that could change the outcome of lung cancer.

Bronchoscopy in the new millennium spells an exciting time for the 
pulmonologist, which likens to Alice peering through the looking glass into a 
wonderland of miniaturized probes, optics, and technology that are advancing at 
a maddening pace. Although scientists continue to push the envelope using 
nanotechnology that may facilitate further miniaturization of probes to allow 
imaging at the cellular or molecular level, it is opportune to evaluate the 
strengths and weaknesses of available technologies and bronchoscopic techniques 
for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, in its early detection and 
palliation. We appraise current technologies and what they hold for the future.

The early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Deeley TJ.

Earlier diagnosis of malignant disease in the lung may bring about improvements 
in the treatment. This article discusses the effects of early diagnosis on the 
prognosis. Cancer of the lung may be associated with other lung pathology, thus 
increasing the problems of diagnosis. Diagnosis depends on radiological 
examination, cytology of the sputum, radio-isotope lung scanning and 
mediastinoscopy: an account is given of how these may be used to diagnose the 
condition whilst it is still at an early stage and suitable for radical 
treatment.
