Abstract
"Delay in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is thought to be a major cause of its poor outcomes. We evaluated the delays within the presentation to the initiation of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions amongst lung cancer patients in Southern Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2019 to March 2021. The data collected through interview included socio-demographic, medical and clinical findings, and the time intervals needed to visit physician, refer to specialist, request diagnostic procedures, reach diagnosis of lung cancer, and hospitalization. Eighty-nine patients (58 males and 31 females) with a mean age of 61.01 ± 12.25 years were included. The median time of symptom presentation and first physician visit interval was 25 days. Sixty-five days were spent for requesting, performing, and evaluating the diagnostic procedures. The median interval between diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 16 days. Totally, it took an average of 122 days from the presentation to the definite diagnosis of lung cancer. Patient-, diagnosis-, and treatment-related delays were not significantly correlated with any of the demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical (disease stage, symptom) variables, as well as the diagnosis tool and the first physician who visited the patient (p > 0.05). There was a significant delay but relatively similar to other countries in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients in Southern Iran. The largest portion of delay could be attributed to the raising clinical suspicion in the physicians, referral for diagnostic assessments, and the diagnosis process. © 2024 The Author(s).

"As catabolic enzyme, CD73 dephosphorylates adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and can also regulate tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. To date, very few studies have explored the role of CD73 in mediating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis, and the underlying transducing signal has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the CD73/Axl axis could regulate Smad3-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote NSCLC metastasis. Mechanically, CD73 can be secreted via the Golgi apparatus transport pathway. Then secreted CD73 may activate AXl by directly bind with site R55 located in Axl extracellular domain independently of GAS6. In addition, we proved that CD73 can stabilize Axl expression via inhibiting CBLB expression. We also identified the distinct function of CD73 activity in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings indicated a role of CD73 in mediating NSCLC metastasis and propose it as a therapeutic target for NSCLC."
"Autophagy serves as a critical regulator of immune responses in sepsis. Macrophages are vital constituents of both innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we delved into the intricate role of p120-catenin (p120) in orchestrating autophagy in macrophages in response to endotoxin stimulation. Depletion of p120 effectively suppressed LPS-induced autophagy in both J774A.1 macrophages and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. LPS not only elevated the interaction between p120 and L chain 3 (LC3) I/II but also facilitated the association of p120 with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). p120 depletion in macrophages by small interfering RNA reduced LPS-induced dissociation of mTOR and Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), leading to an increase in the phosphorylation of ULK1. p120 depletion also enhanced LPS-triggered macrophage apoptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved caspase 3, 7-aminoactinomycin D staining, and TUNEL assay. Notably, inhibiting autophagy reversed the decrease in apoptosis caused by LPS stimulation in macrophages overexpressing p120. Additionally, the ablation of p120 inhibited autophagy and accentuated apoptosis in alveolar macrophages in LPS-challenged mice. Collectively, our findings strongly suggest that p120 plays a pivotal role in fostering autophagy while concurrently hindering apoptosis in macrophages, achieved through modulation of the mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway in sepsis. This underscores the potential of targeting macrophage p120 as an innovative therapeutic avenue for treating inflammatory disorders.

"This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305, versus chemotherapy alone for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. 10-year Markov model was developed using a 21-day cycle length. Transition probabilities were derived from the ORIENT-31 trial, while cost and health state utilities were obtained from publicly databases, local hospitals, and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the primary model output and compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold range of $15,289.34 to $38,223.34 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. In the base-case analysis, sintilimab plus IBI305 and chemotherapy had an ICER of $53,266.32/QALYs, exceeding the upper WTP threshold. Sintilimab plus chemotherapy had an ICER of $15,329.11/QALY, slightly above the lower WTP threshold. Subgroup analysis yielded consistent results. Deterministic sensitivity analyses found no ICER for sintilimab plus chemotherapy beyond the upper WTP threshold. Most model input changes did not decrease the ICER of sintilimab plus IBI305 and chemotherapy below the upper WTP threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses further demonstrated the cost-effectiveness superiority of sintilimab plus chemotherapy over sintilimab plus IBI305 and chemotherapy. This study supports the cost-effectiveness of using sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of combining sintilimab with IBI305 and chemotherapy in this particular patient group may be lacking. Copyright: © 2024 Peng et al.

"4D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) plays a critical role in adaptive radiation therapy for lung cancer. However, extremely sparse sampling projection data will cause severe streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images. Existing deep learning (DL) methods heavily rely on large labeled training datasets which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. Restricted by this dilemma, DL models often struggle with simultaneously retaining dynamic motions, removing streak degradations, and recovering fine details. To address the above challenging problem, we introduce a Deep Prior Image Constrained Motion Compensation framework (DPI-MoCo) that decouples the 4D CBCT reconstruction into two sub-tasks including coarse image restoration and structural detail fine-tuning. In the first stage, the proposed DPI-MoCo combines the prior image guidance, generative adversarial network, and contrastive learning to globally suppress the artifacts while maintaining the respiratory movements. After that, to further enhance the local anatomical structures, the motion estimation and compensation technique is adopted. Notably, our framework is performed without the need for paired datasets, ensuring practicality in clinical cases. In the Monte Carlo simulation dataset, the DPI-MoCo achieves competitive quantitative performance compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we test DPI-MoCo in clinical lung cancer datasets, and experiments validate that DPI-MoCo not only restores small anatomical structures and lesions but also preserves motion information."
"Utidelone is an ebomycin derivative chemotherapeutic drug, which can promote tubulin polymerization and stabilize microtubule structure, so as to induce apoptosis. The drug is an innovative drug independently developed by China with independent intellectual property rights. Phase II clinical trials for advanced breast cancer are being approved by National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. However, there is no report on the application in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. This case is a patient with EGFR mutant stage IV NSCLC who has progressed after third-line targeted therapy. The fourth line was treated with utidelone combined with pabolizumab. The patient had progressed after targeted therapy with oxitinib, ametinib, and vometinib. Due to the patient's physical reasons, the traditional platinum drugs were not suitable, so the patient was treated with utidelone combined with pabolizumab. The curative effect was evaluated as SD after two cycles and progesterone receptor after four cycles. At present, it is still in the maintenance of reduction of utidelone combined with pabolizumab, and the tumor continues to shrink. Although peripheral neurotoxicity occurred during treatment, it improved after symptomatic treatment. The treatment of EGFR mutant stage IV NSCLC with utidelone combined with pabolizumab has good effect and mild adverse reactions. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"The enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) is significant in cancers, but its role in lung cancer is understudied. We divided lung cancer patients into high and low ERH expression groups based on tumor tissue levels. Using the log-rank test, we analyzed the correlation between ERH expression and patient prognosis. The effects of high ERH expression on lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed using CCK8, EDU, transwell, and wound healing assays. ERH expression was significantly higher in cancerous versus normal lung tissue ( p p -7 p Upregulation of ERH in lung cancer tissue is associated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration."
"Liver cancer (LC) is among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with existing treatments showing limited efficacy. This study aimed to elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) as a potential therapeutic target in LC. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to analyse the expression of PYCR1 in LC cells and tissues. EdU assays, colony-forming assays, scratch wound healing assays, Transwell assays, nude mouse xenograft models and nude mouse lung metastasis models were used to detect the growth and metastasis abilities of LC cells. Transcriptome sequencing was used to search for downstream target genes regulated by PYCR1, and metabolomics was used to identify the downstream metabolites regulated by PYCR1. ChIP assays were used to analyse the enrichment of H3K18 lactylation in the IRS1 promoter region. We found that the expression of PYCR1 was significantly increased in HCC and that this high expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Knockout or inhibition of PYCR1 inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we revealed that knocking out or inhibiting PYCR1 could inhibit glycolysis in HCC cells and reduce H3K18 lactylation of the IRS1 histone, thereby inhibiting IRS1 expression. Our findings identify PYCR1 as a pivotal regulator of LC progression that influences tumour cell metabolism and gene expression. By demonstrating the potential of targeting PYCR1 to inhibit LC cell proliferation and metastasis, this study identified PYCR1 as a promising therapeutic target for LC. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) promotes the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer (LC) cells. The expression of PYCR1 in LC is regulated by DNA methylation. Knocking down or inhibiting PYCR1 inhibits glycolysis as well as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways in LC cells. PYCR1 regulates the transcriptional activity of IRS1 by affecting H3K18 lactylation in its promoter region. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Lung cancer remains the most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Although immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the treatment of advanced lung cancer, many patients still do not respond well, often due to the lack of functional T cell infiltration. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using expanded immune cells has emerged as an important therapeutic modality. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy is one form of ACT involving the administration of expanded and activated autologous T cells derived from surgically resected cancer tissues and reinfusion into patients and holds great therapeutic potential for lung cancer. In this review, TIL therapy is introduced and its suitability for lung cancer is discussed. Then its historical and clinical developments are summarized, and the methods developed up-to-date to identify tumor-recognizing TILs and optimize TIL composition. Some perspectives toward future TIL therapy for lung cancer are also provided. © 2024 The Author(s). Advanced Science published by Wiley‐VCH GmbH."
"Improvements in cancer control have led to a drastic increase in cancer survivors who may be at an elevated risk of developing subsequent primary cancers (SPC). In this study, we assessed the risk and patterns of SPC development among 196,858 adult cancer survivors in Alberta, Canada. We used data from the Alberta Cancer Registry to identify all first primary cancers occurring between 2004 and 2020. A SPC was considered as the next primary cancer occurring in a different site. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for SPC development as the observed number of SPC (O) divided by the expected number of SPC (E), where E is a weighted-sum of the population-based year-age-sex-specific incidence rates and the corresponding person-years of follow-up. The risk of developing a SPC up to fifteen years after an initial cancer was 16.2% for males and 12.2% for females. Overall, both males (SIR=1.50) and females (SIR=1.58) had an increased risk of a SPC. There were significant increases in SPC risk for nearly all age groups, with a greater than 5-fold increase for survivors diagnosed between ages 18-39. Screen-detectable cancers including colorectal, lung, cervix, and breast accounted for 46% and 27% of SPCs among females and males. Cancer survivors of nearly every initial site had substantially increased risk of a SPC, compared to the cancer risk in the general population. Screen-detectable cancers were common SPC sites and highlights the need to investigate optimal strategies for screening the growing population of cancer survivors."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Definitive treatment includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Tumour hypoxia impacts the efficacy of these treatment modalities. Novel positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging has been developed to non-invasively quantify hypoxic tumour subregions, and to guide personalised treatment strategies. This review evaluates the reliability of hypoxia imaging in NSCLC in relation to various tracers, its correlations to treatment-related outcomes, and to assess if this imaging modality can be meaningfully applied into radiation therapy workflows. A literature search was conducted on the Medline (Ovid) and Embase databases. Searches included terms related to 'hypoxia', 'positron-emission tomography', 'magnetic resonance imaging' and 'lung cancer'. Results were filtered to exclude studies prior to 2011, and animal studies were excluded. Only studies referring to a confirmed pathology of NSCLC were included, while disease staging was not a limiting factor. Full-text English language and translated literature examined included clinical trials, clinical cohort studies and feasibility studies. Quantification of hypoxic volumes in a pre-treatment setting is of prognostic value, and indicative of treatment response. Dosimetric comparisons have highlighted potential to significantly dose escalate to hypoxic volumes without risk of additional toxicity. However, clinical data to support these strategies are lacking. Heterogenous study design and non-standardised imaging parameters have led to a lack of clarity regarding the application of hypoxia PET imaging in NSCLC. PET imaging using nitroimidazole tracers is the most investigated method of non-invasively measuring tumour hypoxia and has potential to guide hypoxia-targeted radiation therapy. Further clinical research is required to elucidate the benefits versus risks of dose-escalation strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Multiple microRNAs encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes, unique subtypes of EVs, differ in healthy and cancer groups of people, and they represent a warning sign for various cancer scenarios. Since all EVs in blood cannot be transferred from donor to recipient cells during a single blood circulation, kidney filtration could pass some untransferred EVs from blood to urine. Previously, we reported on the ability of zinc oxide nanowires to capture EVs based on surface charge and hydrogen bonding; these nanowires extracted massive numbers of microRNAs in urine, seeking cancer-related microRNAs through statistical analysis. Here, we report on the scalability of the nanowire performance capability to comprehensively capture EVs, including exosomes, in urine, extract microRNAs from the captured EVs  in situ"
"Cisplatin resistance is common in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aimed to identify a new function of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) in NSCLC‑associated cisplatin resistance. Using A549 human NSCLC cells and the cisplatin‑resistant variant, stable cell lines with GOLPH3 knockdown or overexpression were established using lentiviral vectors. Through Cell Counting Kit‑8 and EdU assays, it was revealed that knockdown of GOLPH3 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC cells. Specifically, flow cytometric analysis showed that GOLPH3 knockdown promoted apoptosis and G 2"
"Cancer will affect more than one in three U.S. residents in their lifetime, and although the diagnosis will be made efficiently in most of these cases, roughly one in five patients will experience a delayed or missed diagnosis. In this integrative review, we focus on missed opportunities in the diagnosis of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer in the ambulatory care environment. From a review of 493 publications, we summarize the current evidence regarding the contributing factors to missed or delayed cancer diagnosis in ambulatory care, as well as evidence to support possible strategies for intervention. Cancer diagnoses are made after follow-up of a positive screening test or an incidental finding, or most commonly, by following up and clarifying non-specific initial presentations to primary care. Breakdowns and delays are unacceptably common in each of these pathways, representing failures to follow-up on abnormal test results, incidental findings, non-specific symptoms, or consults. Interventions aimed at 'closing the loop' represent an opportunity to improve the timeliness of cancer diagnosis and reduce the harm from diagnostic errors. Improving patient engagement, using 'safety netting,' and taking advantage of the functionality offered through health information technology are all viable options to address these problems. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent form of endocrine cancer. Therefore, the administration of new therapeutic agents for thyroid cancer patients is necessary. One of the recent successes in thyroid cancer research is the identification of the role of signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of the disease. Emerging evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can serve as novel therapeutic approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT1) plays key roles in gene expression, RNA processing, and epigenetic regulation. It is believed that MALAT1 can regulate several cancer-related processes, including tumour cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis. MALAT1 is involved in the pathogenesis of thzroid cancers by targeting multiple downstream targets and miRNA/mRNA axes. Here, we summarize the emerging roles of MALAT1 in this cancer.

"With significant advancements in the study of DNA Damage Response (DDR) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) signaling, we previously introduced the term ""FA signaling"" to encompass ""all signaling transductions involving one or more FA proteins."" This network has now evolved into the largest cellular defense network, integrating over 30 key players, including ATM, ATR, BLM, HRR6, RAD18, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, PALB2, RAD51C, SLX4, ERCC4, RAD51, BRCA1, UBE2T, XRCC2, MAD2L2, RFWD3, FAAP20, FAAP24, FAAP100, and CENPX. This system responds to both endogenous and exogenous cellular insults. However, the mutational signatures associated with this defense mechanism in non-FA human cancers have not been extensively explored. In this study, we report that different types of human cancers are characterized by distinct somatically mutated genes related to DDR/FA signaling, each accompanied by a unique spectrum of potential driver mutations. For example, in pan-cancer samples, ATM emerges as the most frequently mutated gene (5%) among the 31 genes analyzed, with the highest number of potential driver mutations (1714), followed by BRCA2 (4% with 970 putative driver mutations). However, this pattern is not universal across specific cancer types. For example, FANCT is the most frequently mutated gene in breast (14%) and liver (4%) cancers. In addition, the alteration frequency of DDR/FA signaling due to these mutations exceeds 70% in a subtype of prostate cancer, with each subtype of brain, breast, lung, and prostate cancers displaying distinct patterns of gene alteration frequency. Furthermore, these gene alteration patterns significantly impact patient survival and disease-free periods. Collectively, our findings not only enhance our understanding of cancer development and progression but also have significant implications for cancer patient care and prognosis, particularly in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

"Dysregulation of lung tissue collagen level plays a vital role in understanding how lung diseases progress. However, traditional scoring methods rely on manual histopathological examination introducing subjectivity and inconsistency into the assessment process. These methods are further hampered by inter-observer variability, lack of quantification, and their time-consuming nature. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a machine learning-driven framework for automated scoring of lung collagen content. Our study begins with the collection of a lung slide image dataset from adult female mice using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. In our proposed approach, first, we manually extracted features based on the 46 statistical parameters of fibrillar collagen. Subsequently, we pre-processed the images and utilized a pre-trained VGG16 model to uncover hidden features from pre-processed images. We then combined both image and statistical features to train various machine learning and deep neural network models for classification tasks. We employed advanced unsupervised techniques like K-means, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to conduct thorough image analysis for lung collagen content. Also, the evaluation of the trained models using the collagen data includes both binary and multi-label classification to predict lung cancer in a urethane-induced mouse model. Experimental validation of our proposed approach demonstrates promising results. We obtained an average accuracy of 83% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) values of 0.96 through the use of a support vector machine (SVM) model for binary categorization tasks. For multi-label classification tasks, to quantify the structural alteration of collagen, we attained an average accuracy of 73% and ROC AUC values of 1.0, 0.38, 0.95, and 0.86 for control, baseline, treatment_1, and treatment_2 groups, respectively. Our findings provide significant potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, understanding disease mechanisms, and improving clinical practice using machine learning and deep learning models. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group."
"Primary gastric small cell carcinoma (GSCC) is an extremely rare type of small cell carcinoma. Its aggressive nature with early widespread metastasis and late detection gives it a poor prognosis with overall survival of <12 months. GSCC is a type of neuroendocrine tumor, and because of its histopathological similarity to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), treatment regimen of GSCC includes the same chemotherapy agents as SCLC.

"The primary goal of this research is to develop treatment-related genomic predictive markers for non-small cell lung cancer by integrating various machine learning algorithms that recommends near-optimal individualized patient treatment for chemotherapy in an effort to maximize efficacy or minimize treatment-related toxicity. This research can contribute toward developing a more refined, accurate and effective therapy accounting for specific patient needs. To accomplish our research goal, we implement ensemble learning algorithms, bagging with regularized Cox regression models and nonparametric tree-based models via Random Survival Forests. A comprehensive meta-database was compiled from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus data repository for lung cancer patients to capture and utilize complex genomic patterns that can predict treatment outcomes more accurately. The developed novel prediction algorithm demonstrates the ability to support complex clinical decision-making processes in the treatment of NSCLC. It effectively addresses patient heterogeneity, offering predictions that are both refined and personalized in improving the precision of chemotherapy regimens prescribed to the eligible patients. This research should contribute substantial advancement of cancer treatments by improving the accuracy and efficacy of chemotherapy treatments for a targeted group of patients who need the right treatment. The integration of complex machine learning techniques with genomic data holds substantial potential to transform current cancer treatment paradigms by providing robust support in clinical decision-making. © The Author(s) 2024."
"Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer, causing worldwide mortality. Therefore, this study is necessary for continuing research into new effective and safe treatments.

"Several tyrosine kinase receptors inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated antiproliferative effects in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We aimed to summarize and appraise the current evidence of the efficacy of TKIs in patients with different types of NETs. We performed a systematic review of clinical trials of TKIs in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic or lung NETs (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024507379). Population characteristics, efficacy, and safety results were summarized by type of NET. Twenty-eight studies were eligible, totaling 2284 patients. While sunitinib remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved TKI in patients with NETs (for patients with pancreatic well-differentiated NETs), recent placebo-controlled randomized trials have demonstrated improved response rates and progression-free survival for patients with progressive and pre-treated well-differentiated pancreatic (cabozantinib or surufatinib) or gastrointestinal (GI) NETs (pazopanib, cabozantinib, or surufatinib). There is limited evidence to support the use of a TKI in patients with lung or grade 3 NETs. The toxicity associated with TKIs follows a class effect, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing fatigue, hypertension, and hand-foot skin reactions. TKIs are effective therapies in patients with pancreatic or GI well-differentiated NETs and should be part of the therapeutical sequencing of these patients. © The Author(s), 2024."
"India is a vast and diverse country with existing variations in the frequency and distribution of cancers across its various parts. In regions lacking population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) in a vast country like India, hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) data become an important source of information on the trends and patterns of a region. To determine the numerical trends of cases of the top ten cancer sites reporting to HBCR of a tertiary care cancer center in Bihar from 2014 to 2021. The details of all histopathologically confirmed cancer cases registered in the HBCR department of radiation oncology, State Cancer Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India between January 2014 and December 2021 were included in this retrospective observational study. All these cases were grouped site-wise and listed in descending order of the total number of cases reported in each group. Cross-tabulation with age and sex distribution was done. The frequency distribution of the top ten leading cancers for every consecutive calendar year was plotted in line diagrams for time trend analysis. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). was used for analysis. Annual percent change (APC) was determined for the number of cases of all ten cancer sites using joinpoint regression analysis (Joinpoint Regression Software, Version 4.0.4-May 2013; Statistical Methodology and Applications Branch, Surveillance Research Program of the US National Cancer Institute; Bethesda, MD, USA). Out of 32,057 total cancer cases registered between Jan 2014 and Dec 2021, 21,848 patients (68.2%) cases constituted the top ten cancers. The top ten cancers among both sexes were cancer gallbladder (n = 4204, 13.1%), head and neck (n = 3395, 10.6%), breast (n = 3392, 10.6%), lung (n = 2069, 6.5%), cervix (n = 2039, 6.4%), hematolymphoid (n = 1930, 6.0%), liver (n = 1572, 4.9%), stomach (n = 1116, 3.5%), ovary (n = 1103, 3.4%), and colon-rectum (n = 1028, 3.2%). Except for cervical and hematolymphoid cancers, the rest all showed a rising trend over consecutive years. Cancer of the gallbladder continues to be among the most common cancers in the region.

"Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the primary treatment modalities in managing cancer patients. Recently, combined RT and immunotherapy (IT) (i.e., radio-IT [RIT]) have been aggressively investigated in managing cancer patients. However, several issues in conducting RIT are challenging, such as incorporating advanced irradiation techniques, predictive/prognostic biomarkers, and other treatment modalities. Several clinical efforts and novel biomarkers have been introduced and developed to solve these challenges. For example, stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy/stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, and FLASH-RT have been applied for delivering precise irradiation to lung and liver tumors in conjunction with IT. Besides, several novel IT agents and incorporations of other therapies, such as targeted and thermal therapies, have been further investigated. The present study reviewed the emerging challenges of RIT in modern oncology. We also evaluated clinical practice, bench research, and multimodality treatments. In addition to several clinically applicable biomarkers, we emphasize the roles of advanced irradiation techniques and epigenetic modification as predictive/prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. For example, 6(m) A-based epigenetic agents demonstrate the potential to enhance the treatment effects of RIT. However, further prospective randomized trials should be conducted to confirm their roles. Copyright: © 2024 Tzu Chi Medical Journal."

The time interval from the diagnosis of lung cancer to the detection of gastrointestinal metastasis ranged from 13 to 142 months. The most common sites of metastasis were the small intestine (eight cases), colon (four cases), and upper gastrointestinal tract (eight cases). The major symptoms included obstruction, perforation, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, anorexia, and anemia. The predominant pathological type was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (seventeen cases). A single ulcer was mostly seen on endoscopy, and some cases showed a slight depression of the intestinal wall. The CT and PET-CT scan revealed bowel wall thickening, intraluminal polypoid masses, and intestinal perforation. Gastrointestinal metastasis of lung cancer is mainly observed in the small intestine, colon, and stomach, and is often detected when severe complications such as gastrointestinal obstruction and perforation occurred. Regular evaluation of gastrointestinal conditions during lung cancer diagnosis and treatment is recommended to improve the diagnostic accuracy and prevent misdiagnosis. © 2024 Liao et al."

"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detecting mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is crucial for treatment selection due to the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in these patients. Describe the prevalence and identify factors associated with survival in stage IV lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations in a real-world setting. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response rate in stage IV lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. Data from 771 patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 2017 and 2021 at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires were analysed. The prevalence of EGFR mutations was 18% (139), with a median follow-up of 30 months. Of these, 118 were treated with EGFR TKIs, with a higher objective response rate observed with osimertinib compared to first or second-generation TKIs. Adverse prognostic factors included an ECOG performance status greater than 1, uncommon mutations, high disease burden and the presence of brain or hepatic metastases. Osimertinib was associated with a reduced risk of progression or death, even after adjusting for these prognostic factors. The median PFS was 13 months, with a significant OS difference between patients treated with osimertinib versus first or second-generation inhibitors. This study underscores the importance of EGFR mutation detection in stage IV lung cancer patients and supports the need for personalised therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in this patient population. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience."
"To evaluate the prognostic impact of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) on overall survival (OS) among Indian older patients with cancer. This observational study was conducted in the geriatric oncology clinic of Tata Memorial Hospital (India). We included all patients who underwent a geriatric assessment (GA) and had a complete blood count available for analysis. The NLR was dichotomized at 3.5, PLR and LMR at the median. Our primary study outcome was OS. Between June 2018 and November 2021, 786 patients were enrolled (median age: 69 years). The most common primary tumour was lung (308, 39.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (261, 33.5%). Metastatic disease was present in 54.3% of patients. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with NLR >3.5 had shorter OS (9.1 months) than NLR <3.5 (15.7 months) (HR: 1.56). Similarly, patients with PLR >183.5 had reduced OS (9.3 months) compared to PLR <183.5 (16.6 months) (HR: 1.56). Conversely, patients with LMR >3.1 showed better OS (14.2) compared to LMR <3.1 (9.8 months) (HR: 0.74). After adjusting for age, performance status, primary tumour, metastatic status and GA-derived factors (function, nutrition and cognition), NLR (HR: 1.25, 95%CI: 1.03-1.52), PLR (HR: 1.34, 95%CI: 1.11-1.63) and LMR (HR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.65-0.95) were associated with OS. In our study of older cancer patients, we identified three key inflammatory markers (NLR >3.5, PLR >183.5, LMR <3.1) as strong predictors of poor OS. These markers remain predictive even after accounting for traditional prognostic factors and GA-derived scales. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience."
"Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a new treatment modality in modern radiotherapy. To ensure the quality of the radiotherapy plan, a physics plan review is routinely conducted by senior clinicians; however, this process is less efficient and less accurate. In this study, a multi-task AutoEncoder (AE) is proposed to automate anomaly detection of VMAT plans for lung cancer patients. The feature maps are first extracted from a VMAT plan. Then, a multi-task AE is trained based on the input of a feature map, and its output is the two targets (beam aperture and prescribed dose). Based on the distribution of reconstruction errors on the training set, a detection threshold value is obtained. For a testing sample, its reconstruction error is calculated using the AE model and compared with the threshold value to determine its classes (anomaly or regular). The proposed multi-task AE model is compared to the other existing AE models, including Vanilla AE, Contractive AE, and Variational AE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the other statistics are used to evaluate the performance of these models. Among the four tested AE models, the proposed multi-task AE model achieves the highest values in AUC (0.964), accuracy (0.821), precision (0.471), and  F The proposed multi-task AE model using two-dimensional (2D) feature maps can effectively detect anomalies in radiotherapy plans for lung cancer patients. Compared to the other existing AE models, the multi-task AE is more accurate and efficient. The proposed model provides a feasible way to carry out automated anomaly detection of VMAT plans in radiotherapy. Copyright © 2024 Huang, Shang, Fan, Hu, Dai, Liu and Yan."
"To assess the molecular profile of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas (FCDTCs) and correlate the identified mutations with the clinical and pathological features of the affected patients.

"Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)is a very common disease with limited treatment options. Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of solid tumors associated with the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, the expression changes in cancer-resistance genes may be biomarkers of hypoxia with value in targeted therapy. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of hypoxia on gene expression and the changes that occur in relation to drug resistance in a human NSCLC cell line (A549). A549 cells were exposed to 72-h hypoxic episodes (<1% oxygen) for a total of 10 episodes (acute). The alterations in gene expression were examined using PCR array technology after 10 episodes of acute hypoxia and compared with normoxic cells. The chemoresistance of hypoxic cells toward doxorubicin was measured using a MTT cell proliferation assay. A549 cells were affected by acute hypoxia leading to induced doxorubicin chemoresistance. Evident changes in the gene expression level were identified following episodes of acute hypoxia. The most important changes occurred in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins osteosarcoma (FOS) pathways and in different nucleic transcription factors such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The present study showed that exposing cells to prolonged periods of hypoxia results in different gene expression changes. There was induction of chemo-resistance due to acute hypoxia. ESR1 and c-FOS are proposed as a potential hypoxia genes in lung cancer. Copyright: © 2024 Abualnadi et al."
"The abnormality of the immune system caused by infection is a contributor to the organ dysfunctions associated with sepsis. The balance between Th17/Treg cells is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Bergapten is a natural furocoumarin and has been reported to alleviate the Th17/Treg imbalance. Here, we explored the effects of bergapten on the inflammation and immune state in mouse models of sepsis. The model was established using the cecal ligation and puncture method. Mice were administered 30 mg/kg bergapten. Histological examination, RT-qPCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effects of bergapten  in vivo Bergapten ameliorated lung damage, reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, inhibited myeloperoxidase activity, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Bergapten also restrained sepsis-induced inflammation via inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB signaling. These effects were accompanied by the restored Th17/Treg balance induced by bergapten. Bergapten decreased the number of Th17 cells and elevated the number of Tregs, and this effect was mediated by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)/Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and STAT3/retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) pathways. Bergapten exerted anti-inflammatory effects in acute lung injury by improving the Th17/Treg balance, which suggested a potential of bergapten as an immunomodulatory drug treating sepsis-associated diseases."
"This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy (OT) in the context of pulmonary metastasectomy. Three databases were assessed. The primary outcome was overall survival. The secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival, ipsilateral recurrence, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Reconstruction of time-to-event data and sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint. After screening, 11 studies were included encompassing 2159 patients undergoing lung metastasectomy (VATS: 827; OT: 1332). Compared to OT, patients who underwent VATS had higher overall survival rates (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.67-0.85; p < 0.01), no significant difference in recurrence-free survival (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.88-1.29; p = 0.48), shorter hospital LOS (MD -1.99 days; 95% CI -2.59 to -1.39; p < 0.01), and no significant difference in ipsilateral recurrence rates (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.52-1.42; p = 0.56). For patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy, VATS strategy is associated with higher survival rates and reduced hospital LOS when compared with OT. Moreover, metastasis recurrence does not seem to be associated with long-term mortality in this population. © 2024 The Author(s). Thoracic Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."
"Breast cancer with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or 2+ with negative in-situ hybridisation (ISH) (HER2-low) can now be targeted by HER2 antibody drug conjugates. We set out to compare HER2 status between matched primary invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) and distant metastases (DM) with clinical-pathological correlation, with specific interest in HER2-low. Biomarker studies and clinical-pathological features of primary IBC with matched DM diagnosed between 2021 and 2022 were retrospectively analysed. HER2 status was assessed per 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines for IHC (4B5) and ISH (IQFISH pharmDX). Bilateral breast primaries were excluded. HER2 IHC 0 to 1+ were reassessed. One hundred and forty-seven cases of primary IBC with matched DM were identified. Biomarkers were performed on core biopsy (n = 74) and resection (n = 73). One hundred and twenty-six (86%) were initially classified as 'HER2-negative'; of these, 67 (46%) were reclassified as HER2-low. Patients with HER2-positive primaries were younger (P = 0.01) and had an increased incidence of micropapillary carcinoma (P = 0.02). HER2-low primaries also had an increased incidence of micropapillary carcinoma (P = 0.02) and oestrogen receptor (ER) positivity (P = 0.02) compared to HER2 0. One hundred and sixty-nine matched DM cases excluding bone metastasis were identified (range = one to seven metastases per IBC). The most common sites of metastases were liver (50 of 169, 30%), lung (36 of 169; 21%), distant lymph node (26 of 169, 15%); 138 DM cases (82%) were previously classified as 'HER2-negative', and 62 (37%) were reclassified as HER2-low. Like HER2-low primaries, HER2-low metastases were frequently ER-positive (52 of 62; 84%) (P = 0.02). Brain metastases were more frequently HER2-positive (five of 32; 16%) (P = 0.04). Comparing HER2 status in matched primaries and DM, HER2 status was discordant in 62 cases (37%). Most changes occurred from HER2-low to HER2 0 (33 of 169, 20%), HER2 0 to HER2-low (17 of 169, 10%) and HER2-low to positive (10 of 169, 6%). All HER2-low to HER2 0 changes were HER2 1+ to 0. In 30 patients with multiple DM sites (47 cases), HER2 status among different DM samples was discordant in 16 patients (53%), mainly from HER2-low to HER2 0 (16 of 47, 34%). A significant proportion of previous 'HER2-negative' primaries and DM cases were reclassified as HER2-low. Discordant HER2 status between IBC primary and metastasis and between different DM sites demonstrated tumour heterogeneity and highlights the need for HER2 retesting in distant metastasis. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"To explore the application value of a multimodal deep learning radiomics (MDLR) model in predicting the risk status of postoperative progression in solid stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 459 patients with histologically confirmed solid stage I NSCLC who underwent surgical resection in our institution from January 2014 to September 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. At another medical center, 104 patients were reviewed as an external validation cohort according to the same criteria. A univariate analysis was conducted on the clinicopathological characteristics and subjective CT findings of the progression and non-progression groups. The clinicopathological characteristics and subjective CT findings that exhibited significant differences were used as input variables for the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to construct the clinical model. We used the transfer learning strategy to train the ResNet18 model, used the model to extract deep learning features from all CT images, and then used the ELM classifier to classify the deep learning features to obtain the deep learning signature (DLS). A MDLR model incorporating clinicopathological characteristics, subjective CT findings and DLS was constructed. The diagnostic efficiencies of the clinical model, DLS model and MDLR model were evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). Univariate analysis indicated that size (p = 0.004), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (p = 0.03), carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA199) (p = 0.003), and pathological stage (p = 0.027) were significantly associated with the progression of solid stage I NSCLC after surgery. Therefore, these clinical characteristics were incorporated into the clinical model to predict the risk of progression in postoperative solid-stage NSCLC patients. A total of 294 deep learning features with nonzero coefficients were selected. The DLS in the progressive group was (0.721 ± 0.371), which was higher than that in the nonprogressive group (0.113 ± 0.350) (p < 0.001). The combination of size、NSE、CA199、pathological stage and DLS demonstrated the superior performance in differentiating postoperative progression status. The AUC of the MDLR model was 0.885 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.842-0.927), higher than that of the clinical model (0.675 (95% CI: 0.599-0.752)) and DLS model (0.882 (95% CI: 0.835-0.929)). The DeLong test and decision in curve analysis revealed that the MDLR model was the most predictive and clinically useful model. MDLR model is effective in predicting the risk of postoperative progression of solid stage I NSCLC, and it is helpful for the treatment and follow-up of solid stage I NSCLC patients. © 2024.

"Dual bronchodilator therapy, consisting of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), has proven effective for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it remains uncertain whether there are efficacy differences between current and former smokers with COPD. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of LABA/LAMA therapies in both these groups. The TOReTO trial assessed lung function, symptoms, health status, the occurrence of exacerbations, clinically significant exacerbations, and the use of LABA/LAMA therapies. These therapies include Tio/Olo, umeclidinium/vilanterol (Umec/Vi), and umeclidinium/vilanterol (Umec/Vi) are used in patients with COPD. The study examined the differences in outcomes between current and former smokers. To balance the baseline characteristics, propensity score matching (PSM) was employed. Data from 967 patients were collected. After PSM, the time to the first acute exacerbation in current smokers was analyzed separately for the three treatment groups and was significantly different between them (p = 0.0457). Among, there are differences in the occurrence of acute exacerbation between treatment and smoking status in Umec/Vi (p = 0.0114). There is no significant difference in the treatment of former smokers among the three different groups of LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations (p = 0.3079). COPD-related symptoms remained stable throughout the treatment period. There were no significant differences in symptom scores, including CAT and mMRC, among the three groups at the end of the study. The three fixed-dose combinations of LABA/LAMA showed no difference in reducing exacerbations in former smokers but did show differences in current smokers. This trend has clinical significance, and future research will be conducted to control influencing variables to validate this point. However, due to the non-randomized study design, these findings should be interpreted with caution. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Low-fat dietary (LFD) pattern refers to a dietary structure with reduced fat intake. The aim was to investigate the association between LFD pattern and risk of head and neck cancer (HNC). Data were derived from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. LFD score was used to assess adherence to an LFD pattern, with higher scores indicating greater adherence. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between LFD score and risk of HNC and its subtypes. To visualize the trend in risk of HNC and its subtypes with changing LFD score, restricted cubic spline plots were utilized. A series of subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. Among 98,459 participants of PLCO trial, 268 cases with HNC were identified during an average of 8.8 years of follow-up. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest compared with the lowest quartiles of LFD score had a lower risk of HNC (HR  Q4 vs. Q1 Q4 vs. Q1 Our findings suggest that adherence to an LFD pattern may lower the risk of HNC in the US population. © 2024.

"In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the pathological N category is identical to it in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and remains unchanged over a decade. Here we verified the discriminability of number of involved nodal stations (nS) in SCLC and compared its efficacy in predicting survival with currently used pathological nodal (pN) staging. We retrospectively analyzed the patients who received operations and were pathologically diagnosed as SCLC at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between 2009 and 2019. X-tile software was adopted to determine optimal cut-off values for nS groups. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to compare survival between different groups. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to evaluate the standardized net benefit. A total of 369 patients were included. The median number of sampled stations was 6 (range 3-11), and the median number of positive stations was 1 (range 0-7). The optimal cutoff for nS groups was: nS0 (no station involved), nS1-2 (one or two stations involved), and nS ≥ 3 (three or more stations involved). Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were statistically different among all adjacent categories within the nS classification (p < 0.001, for both OS and RFS between each two subgroups), but survival curves for subgroups in pN overlapped (OS, p = 0.067; RFS, p = 0.068, pN2 vs. pN1). After adjusting for other confounders, nS was a prognostic indicator for OS and RFS. The DCA revealed that nS had improved predictive capability than pN. Our cohort study demonstrated that the nS might serve as a superior indicator to predict survival than pN in SCLC and was worth considering in the future definition of the N category. © 2024.

"The release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes from human mesenchymal stroma/stem-like cells (MSC) represents valuable cell-free carriers for the delivery of regenerative and medicinal compounds. EVs/exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from four individual MSC as controls and after treatment with a sub-lethal concentration of 10 mM taxol for 24 h, respectively. The isolated EVs/exosomes were characterized and quantified by nano-tracking-analysis and by Western blots. MicroRNAs (miRs) were isolated from the different EVs/exosome populations and expression levels were quantified by qPCR using 1246 miR templates. Cytotoxic effects of the different MSC-derived taxol-loaded EVs/exosomes were determined in five different GFP-transduced cancer cell lines and quantified by a fluoroscan assay with a GFP-detecting fluorimeter. The presence of stroma cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in MSC-derived EVs/exosomes and its enhanced expression in the vesicles after taxol treatment of MSC was quantified by a specific ELISA. EVs/exosomes isolated from four individual taxol-treated MSC displayed a larger size and higher yields as the control EVs/exosomes and were used as anti-tumor therapeutic vehicles. Application of each of the four MSC-derived taxol-loaded EVs/exosome populations revealed significant cytotoxic effects in cell lines of five different tumor entities (carcinomas of lung, breast, ovar, colon, astrocytoma) in a concentration-dependent manner. Expression analysis of 1246 miRs in these taxol-loaded EVs/exosomes as compared to the corresponding MSC-derived control EVs/exosomes unraveled a taxol-mediated up-regulation of 11 miRs with predominantly anti-tumorigenic properties. Moreover, various constitutively expressed protein levels were unanimously altered in the MSC cultures. Taxol treatment of the different MSC revealed an up-regulation of tetraspanins and a 2.2-fold to 5.4-fold increased expression of SDF-1 among others. Treatment of cancer cells with MSC-derived taxol-loaded EVs/exosomes in the presence of a neutralizing SDF-1 antibody significantly abolished the cytotoxic effects between 20.3% and 27%. These findings suggested a taxol-mediated increase of anti-cancer properties in MSC that enhance the tropism of derived EVs/exosomes to tumors, thereby specifically focusing the therapeutic effects of the delivered products. © 2024.

"The single-inhaler triple combination of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G) is available for maintenance therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cardinal features of COPD are lung hyperinflation and reduced exercise capacity. TRIFORCE aimed to evaluate the effect of BDP/FF/G on lung hyperinflation and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. This double-blind, randomised, active- and placebo-controlled, crossover study recruited adults with COPD aged ≥ 40 years, who were hyperinflated and symptomatic, and were receiving mono- or dual inhaled maintenance COPD therapy. In the three treatment periods, patients were randomised to receive BDP/FF/G, BDP/FF, or placebo, each for 3 weeks, with a 7-10-day washout between treatment periods. Assessments included slow inspiratory spirometry (for resting inspiratory capacity [IC]) and constant work-rate cycle ergometry (for dynamic IC and exercise endurance time). The primary objective was to compare BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF vs. placebo for resting IC at Week 3. Key secondary objectives were to compare BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF vs. placebo for dynamic IC and exercise endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry at Week 3. Of 106 patients randomised, 95 completed the study. Resting IC adjusted mean differences vs. placebo were 315 and 223 mL for BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF, respectively (p < 0.001 for both). Adjusted mean differences vs. placebo for the key secondary endpoints were: 245 mL for dynamic IC (p < 0.001) and 69.2 s for exercise endurance time (nominal p < 0.001) with BDP/FF/G, and 96 mL (p = 0.053) and 70.1 s (nominal p < 0.001) with BDP/FF. Differences between BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF for resting and dynamic IC were 92 and 149 mL (p < 0.01 for both). All three treatments were generally well tolerated, with 27.3%, 25.3% and 19.0% of patients reporting adverse events with BDP/FF/G, BDP/FF and placebo, respectively, all mild or moderate. In patients with COPD, BDP/FF/G provided significant and clinically relevant improvements vs. placebo and BDP/FF in static and dynamic hyperinflation, with an improvement vs. placebo in exercise endurance.

"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. Hypoxia conditions affect multiple cellular processes promoting the adaptation and progression of cancer cells via the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and subsequent transcription activation of their target genes. Preliminary studies have suggested that estrogen receptor β (ERβ) might play a promoting role in the progression of NSCLC. However, the precise mechanisms, particularly its connection to HIF-1α-mediated modulation under hypoxia, remain unclear. Our findings demonstrated that the overexpression of ERβ, not ERα, increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in NSCLC cells and xenografts. Tissue microarray staining revealed a strong correlation between the protein expression of HIF-1α and ERβ. HIF-1α induced ERβ gene transcription and protein expression in CoCl 2 2 © 2024.

"Initially, identified as a Hodgkin lymphoma marker, CD30 was subsequently detected on a subset of human B cells within and around germinal centers (GCs). While CD30 expression is typically restricted to a few B cells, expansion of CD30-expressing B cells occurs in certain immune disorders and during viral infections. The role of CD30 in B cells remains largely unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we established a conditional CD30-knockin mouse strain. In these mice, B-cell-specific CD30 expression led to a normal B-cell phenotype in young mice, but most aged mice exhibited significant expansion of B cells, T cells and myeloid cells and increased percentages of GC B cells and IgG1-switched cells.

"High heterogeneity in clinical benefit characterizes the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We prospectively enrolled 113 advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs and performed liquid biopsy at the time of ICI start (T1), after 3 weeks (T2) and at the time of radiological evaluation (T3). Molecular variables were associated with outcome endpoints: cfDNA quantification, its dynamic change (∆T2-T1), variant allele frequency (VAF) of the gene with the highest frequency detected at baseline with NGS (maxVAF) and its dynamic change (∆T2-T1). At multivariate analysis, PD-L1 negativity, T1 cfDNA, cfDNA increase (∆T2-T1), and T2 VAF were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS); PD-L1 negativity, squamous histology, T1 cfDNA, cfDNA (∆T2-T1) increase, and T2 maxVAF affected overall survival (OS). Among high PD-L1 expressing patients treated in first-line, elevated T2 maxVAF and cfDNA increase (∆T2-T1) correlated with worse PFS; higher T2 maxVAF and cfDNA increase (∆T2-T1) with worse OS. Derived integrated models were used to build nomograms and categorize different risk groups. © 2024. The Author(s)."

"This study explores the relationship between microbial diversity and disease status in human lung cancer tissue microbiomes, using a sample size of 1,212. Analysis divided the data into primary tumor (PT) and normal tissue (NT) categories. Differences in microbial diversity between PT and NT were significant in 57% of comparisons, although dataset dependence was a factor in the diversity levels. Shared species analysis (SSA) indicated no significant differences between PT and NT in over 90% of comparisons. Network diversity assessments revealed significant differences between NT and PT regarding species relative abundances and network link abundances for q=0-3. Additionally, at q=0, significant variations were found between NT and LUSC in network link probabilities, illustrating the diversity in species interactions. Our findings suggest a stable overall microbiome diversity and composition in lung cancer patients' lung tissues despite patients with diagnosed lung tumors, indicating modified microbial interactions within the tumor. These results highlight an association between altered microbiome interaction patterns and lung tumors, offering new insights into the ecological dynamics of lung cancer microbiomes. © The Author(s) 2024.

"To study programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The study included samples from 50 early-stage NSCLCs. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides (clone SP263) were scored manually and with two different AI tools (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology) by three pathologists. TILs were digitally assessed on H&E and CD8 IHC stained sections with two different algorithms (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology, respectively). The agreement between observers and methods for each biomarker was analysed. For PD-L1, the turn-around time (TAT) for manual versus AI-assisted scoring was recorded. Agreement was higher in tumours with low PD-L1 expression regardless of the approach. Both AI-powered tools identified a significantly higher number of cases equal or above 1% PD-L1 tumour proportion score as compared with manual scoring (p=0.00015), a finding with potential therapeutic implications. Regarding TAT, there were significant differences between manual scoring and AI use (p value <0.0001 for all comparisons). The total TILs density with the PathAI algorithm and the total density of CD8+ cells with the Navify Digital Pathology software were significantly correlated (τ=0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61), p value<0.0001). This preliminary study supports the use of AI algorithms for the scoring of PD-L1 and TILs in patients with NSCLC. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of global mortality, with current screening and diagnostic methods often lacking in sensitivity and specificity. In our endeavor to develop precise, objective, and easily accessible diagnostic biomarkers for NSCLC, this study aimed to leverage rapidly evolving liquid biopsy techniques in the field of pathology to differentiate NSCLC patients from healthy controls by isolating peripheral blood samples and enriching extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing lung-derived proteins (TTF-1 and SFTPB), along with the cancer-associated protein CD151 + + + + + + + Copyright © 2024.
