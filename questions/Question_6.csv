Abstract
"Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a significant clinical concern for which no approved treatment is currently available. The purpose of this trial was to investigate the neuro-prophylactic impact of pentoxifylline against paclitaxel-induced PN in patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BC). BC patients who were assigned to paclitaxel chemotherapy were randomly allocated to pentoxifylline or a control group for 12 weeks. The main outcomes included the assessment of PN incidence according to the defined Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, quality of life (QoL) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-NTx) scale, and neuropathic pain using the scale of self-reported Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (s-LANSS). The code of the clinical trial registration is NCT06562998. The current study included a total of 72 patients allocated into pentoxifylline arm (n = 35) and placebo arm (n = 37). By the 12th week, the prevalence of PN (grade 2 or 3) was significantly lower in the pentoxifylline arm 10/35 (28.6%) compared to 24/37 (64.9%) of the controls (P value = 0.016). The total FACT/GOG-NTx score indicated a considerably worse QoL in the control group [98.18 (10.2) vs. 81.43 (14.8) for pentoxifylline and the control group, respectively, P < 0.001] with a mean difference of -16.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): -23.97 to -9.53]. S-LANSS scale showed significantly higher scores after 6 weeks [13.72 (5.86) vs. 17.52 (3.16), P = 0.002] and 12 weeks [17.84 (4.25) vs. 23.80 (1.00), P < 0.001] for pentoxifylline and control group, respectively. In conclusion, the use of pentoxifylline showed a significant reduction in paclitaxel-induced PN, which improved their QoL. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the female population. Axillary lymph nodes (ALN) are a group of the most common metastatic sites of breast cancer. Timely assessment of ALN status is of paramount clinical importance for medical decision making. To utilize contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-based radiomics models for noninvasive pretreatment prediction of ALN status. Clinical data and pretreatment CEUS images of primary breast tumors were retrospectively studied to build radiomics signatures for pretreatment prediction of nodal status between May 2015 and July 2021. The cases were divided into the training cohorts and test cohorts in a 9:1 ratio. The mRMR approach and stepwise forward logistic regression technique were used for feature selection, followed by the multivariate logistic regression technique for building radiomics signatures in the training cohort. The confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used for accessing the prediction efficacy of the radiomics models. The radiomics models, which consist of six features, achieved predictive accuracy with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.713 in the test set for predicting lymph node metastasis. The CEUS-based radiomics is promising to be developed as a reliable noninvasive tool for predicting ALN status. © 2024 The Author(s). Cancer Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"The study objective was to determine the effectiveness of a prehabilitation program to decrease postoperative musculoskeletal impairments in patients who have breast cancer and are receiving neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Patients who had breast cancer and were receiving NAT before surgery were invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Patients randomized to the intervention group participated in a group-based prehabilitation program consisting of Nordic walking, resistance training, and therapeutic education from month 4 of NAT until before surgery. Patients in the control group received usual care (no prehabilitation). The main outcome was arm function measured with the short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire 1 month after surgery. Other measures included pain, range of motion, functional capacity, cancer-related fatigue, handgrip strength, physical activity, and arm circumferences. A total of 64 patients were randomized during the study period, and 61 completed all assessments. A significant difference in the main outcome (short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) was found before surgery as patients in the control group experienced worsening in arm function (mean difference = -9.84, 95% CI = -17.7 to -2). In addition, they also showed increased symptom frequency/severity according to the combined scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) (mean difference = +6.7 points, 95% CI = 13.4 to 0.1) compared to the intervention group. Prehabilitation also improved functional capacity (mean difference = 67.6 m, 95% CI = 37.4 to 97.7) and physical activity levels and decreased cancer-related fatigue (mean difference = -1.3, 95% CI = -0.29 to -2.4) compared to the control group but had no effect on other secondary outcomes. After surgery, patients receiving prehabilitation also exhibited greater functional capacity at both 1 and 3 months. No other difference was observed. A prehabilitation program was able to maintain arm function and increase functional capacity while decreasing fatigue in patients with breast cancer receiving NAT. Prehabilitation programs should be offered to patients with breast cancer to maintain functionality and enhance physical performance before surgery. An exercise program combined with therapeutic education in patients with breast cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy before surgery can improve functional capacity and prevent declines of arm mobility and function. © The Author(s) 2024.

"One of the main health issues in the modern world is cancer, with breast cancer (BC) as one of the most common types of malignancies. Different environmental and genetic risk factors are involved in the development of BC. One of the primary genes implicated in cancer development is the p53 gene, which is also known as the ""gatekeeper"" gene. p53 is involved in cancer development by interacting with numerous pathways and signaling factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs, resulting in their translational inhibition or degradation. If the p53 gene is mutated or degraded, it can contribute to the risk of BC by disrupting the expression of miRNAs. Similarly, the disruption of miRNAs causes the negative regulation of p53. Therefore, the p53/miRNA axis is a crucial pathway in the progression or prevention of BC, and understanding the regulation and function of this pathway may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies to help treat BC."
"There are currently no molecular tests to identify individual breast cancers where radiotherapy (RT) offers no benefit. Profile for the Omission of Local Adjuvant Radiotherapy (POLAR) is a 16-gene molecular signature developed to identify low risk cancers where RT will not further reduce recurrence rates. An individual participant data meta-analysis was performed in 623 cases of node-negative ER+/HER2-negative early breast cancer enrolled in three RT randomized trials for whom primary tumor material was available for analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model on time to locoregional recurrence (LRR) was used to test the interaction between POLAR score and RT. 429 (69%) patients' tumors had a high POLAR score and 194 (31%) had a low score. Patients with high POLAR score had, in the absence of RT, a 10-year cumulative incidence of LRR: 20% (15%-26%) vs 5% (2%-11%) for those with a low score. Patients with a high POLAR score had a large benefit from RT (hazard ratio [HR] for RT vs no RT: 0.37 [0.23-0.60], p < .001). In contrast, there was no evidence of benefit from RT for patients with a low POLAR score (HR: 0.92 [0.42-2.02], p = .832). The test for interaction between RT and POLAR was statistically significant (p = .022). POLAR is not only prognostic for locoregional recurrence but also predictive of benefit from radiotherapy in selected patients. Patients ≥ 50 years with ER+/HER2-negative disease and a low POLAR score could consider omitting adjuvant RT. Further validation in contemporary clinical cohorts is required. © The Author(s) 2024.

"Utidelone is an ebomycin derivative chemotherapeutic drug, which can promote tubulin polymerization and stabilize microtubule structure, so as to induce apoptosis. The drug is an innovative drug independently developed by China with independent intellectual property rights. Phase II clinical trials for advanced breast cancer are being approved by National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. However, there is no report on the application in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. This case is a patient with EGFR mutant stage IV NSCLC who has progressed after third-line targeted therapy. The fourth line was treated with utidelone combined with pabolizumab. The patient had progressed after targeted therapy with oxitinib, ametinib, and vometinib. Due to the patient's physical reasons, the traditional platinum drugs were not suitable, so the patient was treated with utidelone combined with pabolizumab. The curative effect was evaluated as SD after two cycles and progesterone receptor after four cycles. At present, it is still in the maintenance of reduction of utidelone combined with pabolizumab, and the tumor continues to shrink. Although peripheral neurotoxicity occurred during treatment, it improved after symptomatic treatment. The treatment of EGFR mutant stage IV NSCLC with utidelone combined with pabolizumab has good effect and mild adverse reactions. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy presents an important downstaging option with lower toxicity than neoadjuvant chemotherapy in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer. Meta-analysis of the effects of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy on surgical outcomes across randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies has not previously been performed. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy on surgical outcomes (PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews, 2020)) compared with surgery followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify RCT and cohort studies between 1946 and 27 March 2024. Two independent reviewers manually screened the identified records and extracted the data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tools and random-effects meta-analysis was done with ReviewManager. The search identified 2390 articles eligible for screening. The review included 20 studies (12 cohort and 8 RCTs); 19 were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 6382 patients. Overall, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with a lower mastectomy rate compared with surgery first (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% c.i. 0.44 to 0.64). Subgroup analysis showed similar improvement in the mastectomy rate in the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy group versus control group irrespective of study type (RCT: RR 0.58, 95% c.i. 0.50 to 0.66; cohorts: RR 0.48, 95% c.i. 0.33 to 0.70). There was no difference in the mastectomy rate by duration of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (more than 4 months: RR 0.57, 95% c.i. 0.42 to 0.78; 4 months or less than 4 months: RR 0.52, 95% c.i. 0.43 to 0.64). Most of the studies were characterized by moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is associated with a reduction in mastectomy rate. Given the moderate methodological quality of previous studies, further RCTs are required. CRD42020209257. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of BJS Foundation Ltd."
"Social support has been linked to increased use of preventive care services. Living arrangements and residential stability may be important structural sources of social support, but few studies have examined their impact on cancer screening. Data were from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey. Participants were classified as up-to-date or not with female breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CVC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model associations between screening and residential stability (< 1 year, 1-3 years, 4-10 years, 11-20 years, or > 20 years), living arrangement (with spouse/partner only, children only, both, or neither), and perceived social support (rarely/never, sometimes, usually, or always available), overall and stratified by sex (CRC) and age group (CVC). The adjusted odds of BC (odds ratio [OR]  0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.81) and CVC (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96) screening were lowest for those who reported never/rarely vs. always having social support. The adjusted odds of BC (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.70) and CRC (OR FEMALE MALE Social support measures were associated with screening to varying degrees by site and age, but higher perceived social support and living with a spouse/partner only demonstrated a consistent positive association. Interventions that mobilize social support networks and address the unmet social needs of parents/caregivers may improve cancer control. © 2024.

"Sialyltransferases are enzymes that play a crucial role in regulating cancer progression by modifying glycoproteins through sialylation. In particular, the ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) enzyme is known to be upregulated in breast cancer, but its specific biological functions have not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact and mechanisms of ST3GAL4 on aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer. We examined ST3GAL4 expression in tumor tissue samples and breast cancer cell lines and also manipulated ST3GAL4 expression in breast cancer cells using lentivirus transduction. The study evaluated cellular processes such as cell viability, cell cycle progression, and aerobic glycolysis by measuring parameters like extracellular acidification rate, glucose uptake, lactate production, and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression. We found that ST3GAL4 expression was consistently increased in tumor tissues and breast cancer cell lines. High ST3GAL4 expression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer. Inhibiting ST3GAL4 expression decreased cell viability, disrupted cell cycle progression, and reduced aerobic glycolysis and LDHA expression. Furthermore, suppressing ST3GAL4 expression in animal models reduced tumor growth and cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpressing ST3GAL4 promoted cell viability and cell cycle progression, but these effects were reversed when an inhibitor of aerobic glycolysis was used. The study provided evidence in cells and animal models that ST3GAL4 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by enhancing aerobic glycolysis. These findings suggest that targeting ST3GAL4 may be a potential strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. © 2024. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Human Cell Society."
"Eribulin is an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. It is not as highly protein bound as the taxanes and is less vulnerable to extrusion by P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These features predict that eribulin could play an active role in managing brain tumors. Indeed, the small amount of published clinical data indicates eribulin may have some efficacy against breast cancer brain metastases. To better understand the potential of eribulin for treating brain tumors, we performed an intracerebral microdialysis study to determine the neuropharmacokinetics of eribulin in cancer patients undergoing tumor resection. After tumor removal, two microdialysis catheters were inserted into peritumoral brain tissue. Approximately 24 h after surgery, a single dose of eribulin 1.4 mg/m 2 Dialysate samples from 12 intracerebral microdialysis catheters placed in 7 study participants were included in the analysis. A statistically significant difference was observed between eribulin concentrations in brain tissue where BBB was disrupted versus intact, with a difference in mean maximum concentrations on log 2 Although we could detect higher concentrations of eribulin in brain tissue where BBB was disrupted, intracerebral eribulin levels were not sufficient to predict eribulin would have consistent clinically meaningful activity against tumors in the brain.

"Benzofuropyridines (BFP) are polycyclic compounds with known applications in neuronal diseases. However, its derivatization patterns and anticancer potential remains unexplored. Leveraging the idea of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), we developed a highly efficient synthetic route for BFP to increase the library of available analogs producing three compounds in one reaction set up, including the 2O-, 6O-, and the 1N-substituted species, also producing the unusual 2-pyridone derivatives. Key bromination reaction of the BFP moiety was successfully described which can widen the available variation in the compounds' structure. The cytotoxic activity of the compounds was assessed against SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), Kb (human oral epidermoid), HeLa (cervical) and MCF-7 (breast) cancer cell lines. In the series, the m-bromobenzyl (5b), methylcyano (5g) and propargyl (5h) 2O-derivatives demonstrated good selectivity against cancer cells with selectivity index (SI) of >71 for 5g against HeLa over the normal cells, as compared to the standard drug, Doxorubicin (SI = 6.7). The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis   revealed an impressive correlation of the defined descriptors with the bioactivity having an R2 value of 0.971 and 0.893 for Kb and HeLa respectively. Altogether, our work highlighted new information on the synthesis of BFP derivatives with potent cytotoxic activity. © 2024 Wiley‐VCH GmbH."
"This study was conducted to determine the levels of Patients' spiritual well-being (SWB) and self-care agency (SCA) of patients receiving chemotherapy with a port catheter. It was a correlational and observational study. Data were collected between December 2021 and March 2022. The sample was 88 people. Of the participants; 59.1% were women, 88.6% were married, 38.6% were primary school graduates, 47.7% were unemployed, and 51.1% had income equal to their expenses. Furthermore, 38.6% patients had breast cancer diagnosis and 52.3% did not have any chronic diseases. Both scale scores were affected by different variables and there was a positive correlation between SCA and SWB. Better SWB positively affected SCA. Patient age and duration after cancer diagnosis affected SCA and SWB. Notably, SCA and SWB levels of the patients may change with age and disease progression, and patients should also be monitored in this respect. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Improvements in cancer control have led to a drastic increase in cancer survivors who may be at an elevated risk of developing subsequent primary cancers (SPC). In this study, we assessed the risk and patterns of SPC development among 196,858 adult cancer survivors in Alberta, Canada. We used data from the Alberta Cancer Registry to identify all first primary cancers occurring between 2004 and 2020. A SPC was considered as the next primary cancer occurring in a different site. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for SPC development as the observed number of SPC (O) divided by the expected number of SPC (E), where E is a weighted-sum of the population-based year-age-sex-specific incidence rates and the corresponding person-years of follow-up. The risk of developing a SPC up to fifteen years after an initial cancer was 16.2% for males and 12.2% for females. Overall, both males (SIR=1.50) and females (SIR=1.58) had an increased risk of a SPC. There were significant increases in SPC risk for nearly all age groups, with a greater than 5-fold increase for survivors diagnosed between ages 18-39. Screen-detectable cancers including colorectal, lung, cervix, and breast accounted for 46% and 27% of SPCs among females and males. Cancer survivors of nearly every initial site had substantially increased risk of a SPC, compared to the cancer risk in the general population. Screen-detectable cancers were common SPC sites and highlights the need to investigate optimal strategies for screening the growing population of cancer survivors."
"Gut microbiota and associated metabolites have been linked to breast carcinogenesis. Evidences demonstrate blood microbiota primarily originates from the gut and may act as a biomarker for breast cancer. We aimed to characterize the microbiota-gut microbial metabolites cross-talk in blood and develop a composite diagnostic panel for breast cancer. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics profiling on blood samples from 107 breast cancer cases and 107 age-paired controls. We found that the alpha diversity of the blood microbiota was decreased in breast cancer compared to controls. There were significantly different profiles of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood between these two groups, with nine bacterial genera and four gut microbial metabolites increased in patients, while thirty-nine bacterial genera and two gut microbial metabolites increased in controls. Some breast cancer-associated gut microbial metabolites were linked to differential blood microbiota, and a composite microbiota-metabolite diagnostic panel was further developed with an area under the curve of 0.963 for breast cancer. This study underscored the pivotal role of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood and their interactions for breast carcinogenesis, as well as the potential of a composite diagnostic panel as a non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer.IMPORTANCEOur integrated analysis demonstrated altered profiles of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood for breast cancer patients. The extensive correlation between microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood assisted the understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The good performance of a composite microbiota-gut microbial metabolites panel in blood suggested a non-invasive approach for breast cancer detection and a novel strategy for better diagnosis and prevention of breast cancer in the future."
"Breast cancer (BC) remains a prevalent and challenging malignancy among women, with significant advancements in treatment strategies over the past decades. Traditional chemotherapy has been progressively supplemented by newer modalities, including Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs), Immunotherapy (IO), and Targeted Therapies (TT). Despite these advancements, there remains a critical need for strategies that maintain efficacy while minimizing toxicity. This review delves into metronomic chemotherapy (MC), a novel approach involving the frequent administration of low-dose chemotherapy without prolonged breaks. We explore MC's impact across various breast cancer subtypes, such as Estrogen Receptor-Positive (ER+), HER2-Positive, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). The literature reviewed highlights MC's mechanisms, including its anti-angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and antiproliferative effects, and its potential to improve treatment tolerability and address drug resistance. MC represents a promising adjunct to existing therapies, particularly in advanced or resistant cases. Its unique dosing schedule could offer sustained antitumor activity with reduced toxicity, making it a viable option for long-term management. However, further research is warranted to establish optimal dosing regimens, identify predictive biomarkers, and delineate its role within combination treatment strategies. Clarifying these aspects could refine MC's application, potentially reshaping treatment paradigms and enhancing patient outcomes in breast cancer management."
"Differential RNA expression is becoming increasingly valuable in evaluating tumor heterogeneity for a better understanding of malignant tumors and guiding personalized therapy. However, traditional techniques for analyzing cellular RNA are mainly focused on determining the absolute level of RNA, which may lead to inaccuracies in understanding tumor heterogeneity, primarily due to i) the subtle differences in certain RNA types that have similar total concentrations and ii) the existence of variations in RNA expression across different samples. Herein, a detachable DNA assembly module is proposed that is capable not only of quantifying the expression level of target RNA but also of innovatively evaluating its proportion within its RNA family population through a sequential assembly and disassembly route. Using the let-7 family as an experimental model, a significant difference is discovered in let-7a proportion between normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells, a characteristic that is often missed in bulk analysis of traditional techniques. By combining concentration and proportion information, the detachable DNA assembly module demonstrates markedly higher efficiency in discerning among various types of cells compared to traditional techniques. This innovative assembly module is expected to offer a new perspective to highlight tumor heterogeneity and guide personalized therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Cancer will affect more than one in three U.S. residents in their lifetime, and although the diagnosis will be made efficiently in most of these cases, roughly one in five patients will experience a delayed or missed diagnosis. In this integrative review, we focus on missed opportunities in the diagnosis of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer in the ambulatory care environment. From a review of 493 publications, we summarize the current evidence regarding the contributing factors to missed or delayed cancer diagnosis in ambulatory care, as well as evidence to support possible strategies for intervention. Cancer diagnoses are made after follow-up of a positive screening test or an incidental finding, or most commonly, by following up and clarifying non-specific initial presentations to primary care. Breakdowns and delays are unacceptably common in each of these pathways, representing failures to follow-up on abnormal test results, incidental findings, non-specific symptoms, or consults. Interventions aimed at 'closing the loop' represent an opportunity to improve the timeliness of cancer diagnosis and reduce the harm from diagnostic errors. Improving patient engagement, using 'safety netting,' and taking advantage of the functionality offered through health information technology are all viable options to address these problems. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Salt‑induced kinase 1 (SIK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a member of the AMP‑activated protein kinase family. SIK is catalytically activated through its phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1. SIK1 has been reported to be associated with numerous types of cancer. The present review summarizes the structure, regulatory factors and inhibitors of SIK1, and also describes how SIK1 is a signal regulatory factor that fulfills connecting roles in various signal regulatory pathways. Furthermore, the anti‑inflammatory effects of SIK1 during the early stage of tumor occurrence and its different regulatory effects following tumor occurrence, are summarized, and through collating the tumor signal regulatory mechanisms in which SIK1 participates, it has been demonstrated that SIK1 acts as a necessary node in cancer signal transduction. In conclusion, SIK1 is discussed independent of the SIKs family, its research results and recent progress in oncology are summarized in detail with a focus on SIK1, and its potential as a therapeutic target is highlighted, underscoring the need for SIK1‑targeted regulatory strategies in future cancer therapy."
"To study the diagnostic value of fluorescent lymphography for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer. The cohort study, conducted at 4 specilized centers between June 2019 and March 2024, included 333 patients with cT1-4 N0-1M0 breast cancer. 50 patients received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, 14 of them had single metastases, confirmed by cytological or histological methods, which clinically completely regressed after systemic treatment. Immediately before the operation, 1 ml (5mg) of indocyanine green was injected subareolarly or subcutaneously into the tumor projection. Fluorescence imaging was performed using various devices for ICG navigation in the open surgical field - MARS, IC-Flow, Stryker SPY-PHI, IC-GOR. In 78 patients after sentinel lymph node biopsy standard axillary lymphadenectomy was performed. Detection level was 99.1%. The average number of sentinel lymph nodes was 3.4. Metastatic lesions of sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 54 of 330 patients (16.4%). The average number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1.6; in 90.7% of cases metastases to 1-2 lymph nodes were registered. Intraoperative morphological examination revealed metastases only in 59% of cases. No systemic adverse events were recorded. The false-negative error rate in the group of patients who underwent axillary lymphadenectomy was 6.6%. The overall accuracy of fluorescent lymphography for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer was 94%. The SLNB technique using fluorescence lymphography is safe and highly accurate as a stand-alone method."
"Breast Cancer stands on the second position in the world in being common and women happen to have it with high rate of about five-folds around the world. The causes of occurrence can matter with different humans be it external factors or the internal genetic ones. Breast cancer is primarily driven by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 susceptibility genes. These BC susceptibility genes encode proteins critical for DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR). Poly (ADP ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the essential enzymes involved in the repairing of the damaged DNA. So the inhibition of these inhibitors can be considered as the promising strategy for targeting cancers with defective damage in the deoxyribonucleic acid. Olaparib and talazoparib are PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are being employed for the monotherapies in case of the deleterious germline HER2-negative and BRCA-mutated breast cancer. The potency of PARP for trapping on DNA and causes cytotoxicity may have difference in the safety and efficacy with the PARPi. The PARPi have been found its place in the all different types of Breast Cancers and have shown potential benefits. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)inhibitors for the improvement in the treatment and management of Breast Cancer.

"With significant advancements in the study of DNA Damage Response (DDR) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) signaling, we previously introduced the term ""FA signaling"" to encompass ""all signaling transductions involving one or more FA proteins."" This network has now evolved into the largest cellular defense network, integrating over 30 key players, including ATM, ATR, BLM, HRR6, RAD18, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, PALB2, RAD51C, SLX4, ERCC4, RAD51, BRCA1, UBE2T, XRCC2, MAD2L2, RFWD3, FAAP20, FAAP24, FAAP100, and CENPX. This system responds to both endogenous and exogenous cellular insults. However, the mutational signatures associated with this defense mechanism in non-FA human cancers have not been extensively explored. In this study, we report that different types of human cancers are characterized by distinct somatically mutated genes related to DDR/FA signaling, each accompanied by a unique spectrum of potential driver mutations. For example, in pan-cancer samples, ATM emerges as the most frequently mutated gene (5%) among the 31 genes analyzed, with the highest number of potential driver mutations (1714), followed by BRCA2 (4% with 970 putative driver mutations). However, this pattern is not universal across specific cancer types. For example, FANCT is the most frequently mutated gene in breast (14%) and liver (4%) cancers. In addition, the alteration frequency of DDR/FA signaling due to these mutations exceeds 70% in a subtype of prostate cancer, with each subtype of brain, breast, lung, and prostate cancers displaying distinct patterns of gene alteration frequency. Furthermore, these gene alteration patterns significantly impact patient survival and disease-free periods. Collectively, our findings not only enhance our understanding of cancer development and progression but also have significant implications for cancer patient care and prognosis, particularly in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

"Despite a higher rate of breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), efforts to treat the disease through breast cancer screening are suboptimal, resulting in late diagnosis of breast cancer and poor outcomes. Several studies have been conducted in SSA countries about screening uptake, yet they addressed country or sub-country level data and did not consider both individual and beyond-individual factors related to screening. Hence, pooled prevalence as well as multilevel correlates of screening in the region is sparse, which have been addressed by this study using the most recent data among women with SSA. This study was conducted using the Demographic Health Survey data (2013-2022) from six countries, and a total weighted sample of 95,248 women was examined. STATA version 16 was used for the data analysis. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed and significant predictors were reported using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The overall weighted prevalence of clinical breast cancer screening was 14.23% (95% CI: 13.97-14.75), with Namibia and Tanzania having the highest (24.5%) and lowest (5.19%) screening rates, respectively. Higher breast cancer screening uptake was observed among women of advanced age (35-49) [aOR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.60, 1.98], had higher educational levels [aOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.03], cohabited [aOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.55], in the richest wealth quintile [aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.95, 2.64], urban residents [aOR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.33], multiparous [aOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.68], visited health facilities [aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.52, 1.76], and read newspapers [aOR = 1.78; 95%CI: 1.60, 2.15]. The prevalence of clinical breast cancer screening was low (14%). Strengthening awareness campaigns, improving healthcare infrastructure, health education, universal health coverage, and screening program access, with a focus on rural areas, women who lack formal education, and low socioeconomic status, are critical to increasing breast cancer screening rates and equity. Scale-up local and regional collaborations and the involvement of media agencies in the implementation of screening programs, advocacy, dissemination of information, and integration of screening programs with their routine care, such as perinatal care, can boost the screening. The existing health service delivery points also need to focus on integrating breast cancer screening services with routine care such as perinatal care.

"The relationship between the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and depression is not well understood. This analysis aims to investigate the relationship between AGR in conjunction with depression in U.S. adults. This study analyzed information from 31,363 individuals collected by NHANES during the years 2005 to 2018. The PHQ-9 scale was employed to gauge depression, where a score of 10 or above signified depression. Weighted multivariable logistic modeling along with smooth curve fitting were applied to explore the AGR-depression connection. To confirm our findings, we carried out sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and interaction tests. After adjusting for confounding variables, a higher AGR is associated with a lower risk of depression (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.79). Dividing AGR into quartiles revealed that participants in the highest quartile (Q4) of AGR had a markedly lower risk of depression than those in the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53-0.77). Using smooth curve fitting, we suggested a possible linear inverse association connecting AGR with depression. Further subgroup and sensitivity analyses supported these findings, although factors such as diabetes and hypertension might influence the relationship. Our findings indicate that elevated AGR levels correlate with a lower risk of depression. The findings suggest AGR as a potential biomarker for depression screening and prevention. Further studies are required to determine causality and clarify the mechanisms between AGR and depression. Copyright © 2024 Xu, Wang, Li and Chen."

"India is a vast and diverse country with existing variations in the frequency and distribution of cancers across its various parts. In regions lacking population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) in a vast country like India, hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) data become an important source of information on the trends and patterns of a region. To determine the numerical trends of cases of the top ten cancer sites reporting to HBCR of a tertiary care cancer center in Bihar from 2014 to 2021. The details of all histopathologically confirmed cancer cases registered in the HBCR department of radiation oncology, State Cancer Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India between January 2014 and December 2021 were included in this retrospective observational study. All these cases were grouped site-wise and listed in descending order of the total number of cases reported in each group. Cross-tabulation with age and sex distribution was done. The frequency distribution of the top ten leading cancers for every consecutive calendar year was plotted in line diagrams for time trend analysis. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). was used for analysis. Annual percent change (APC) was determined for the number of cases of all ten cancer sites using joinpoint regression analysis (Joinpoint Regression Software, Version 4.0.4-May 2013; Statistical Methodology and Applications Branch, Surveillance Research Program of the US National Cancer Institute; Bethesda, MD, USA). Out of 32,057 total cancer cases registered between Jan 2014 and Dec 2021, 21,848 patients (68.2%) cases constituted the top ten cancers. The top ten cancers among both sexes were cancer gallbladder (n = 4204, 13.1%), head and neck (n = 3395, 10.6%), breast (n = 3392, 10.6%), lung (n = 2069, 6.5%), cervix (n = 2039, 6.4%), hematolymphoid (n = 1930, 6.0%), liver (n = 1572, 4.9%), stomach (n = 1116, 3.5%), ovary (n = 1103, 3.4%), and colon-rectum (n = 1028, 3.2%). Except for cervical and hematolymphoid cancers, the rest all showed a rising trend over consecutive years. Cancer of the gallbladder continues to be among the most common cancers in the region. Focused research in all aspects of this deadly disease is needed. Strengthening of prevention and screening programs for common cancers and upliftment of the existing infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the region are necessitated.

"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been widely used for improving psychological symptoms and sleep quality in breast cancer patients and has a positive impact on posttraumatic growth and immunology. Moreover, MBSR is increasingly being used in cancer-related fatigue (CRF) intervention studies for breast cancer patients, but conflicting results also exist. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of MBSR on CRF in patients with breast cancer. A comprehensive computer search of the Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biomedical Document Service System, China Knowledge Infrastructure Engineering, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP databases was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before April 10, 2023, were identified. The primary outcome was cancer-related fatigue associated with breast cancer. Two researchers independently screened the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the methodological quality of the studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Meta-analysis of the outcome indicators was performed using STATA 16.0 software. A total of 13 studies were included, including 1992 patients (997 patients in the MBSR group and 1015 patients in the control group). Compared with conventional care, MBSR significantly alleviated the symptoms of CRF in breast cancer patients (SMD=-0.32, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.22], z=6.54, p<.01). Under the supervision of experts, the 8-week MBSR had a great influence on CRF, especially in the Asian population. MBSR is effective in the treatment of CRF induced by breast cancer, and no obvious adverse effects occur; thus, MBSR can be recommended as a beneficial adjuvant therapy for treating CRF in breast cancer patients. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42021245365.

"The anti-angiogenic agent anlotinib offers a new treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with brain metastases. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in the treatment of TNBC patients with brain metastases. Between October 2019 and April 2024, 29 TNBC patients with brain metastases who had failed prior therapy and were treated with anlotinib were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was central nervous system (CNS) progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), intracranial disease control rate (iDCR), intracranial objective response rate (iORR), and safety. The median CNS PFS of 29 patients was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-10.9 months), and the median OS was 10.2 months (95% CI, 5.6-14.8 months). The iORR and iDCR were 31.0% and 86.2%, respectively. Five patients (17.2%) experienced grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), with bone marrow suppression (2/29, 6.9%) being the most common. Most AEs were clinically manageable, and no treatment-related death was observed. Anlotinib demonstrated encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity in the treatment of TNBC patients with brain metastases who had failed standard treatment.

"Randomised evidence supports the use of partial breast irradiation (PBI) with targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) for early stage breast cancer, but prospective data from real-world adoption of this technique is also important. The aim of this study was to determine if the outcome reported in TARGIT-A trial could be replicated in large cohort of early stage breast cancer treated with TARGIT-IORT. This prospective observational study analysed all patients treated with TARGIT-IORT between 2004 and 2021 in a single national cancer institute. TARGIT-IORT during lumpectomy was performed according to the risk-adapted TARGIT-A protocol using the Intrabeam ® The study included 814 patients and the a median follow up was 72 months. The majority of patients (60.3%) received TARGIT-IORT as PBI modality (""exclusive IORT"" group); 39.7% received additional EBRT. There was no significant difference between the 5 years IBTR for the whole study population and the ""exclusive IORT"" cohort (1.6% (95%CI=1.1-2.1%) and 2.5% (95%CI=1.7%-3.3%) respectively). 5 years overall survival and tumour related survival were >95%. In 21% of patients with recurrence, breast was preserved. Radiotherapy toxicity (CTCAE Grade>2) was very rare (0.9%). This large single institute study found that breast cancer control and survival outcomes with TARGIT-IORT were consistent with TARGIT-A trial results. This ""real world"" experience confirmed that the randomised evidence showing the value of TARGIT-IORT as partial breast irradiation modality that can be replicated in routine clinical practice.

"Since 2020, breast cancer has remained the most prevalent cancer worldwide and the World Health Organisation projects significant increases by 2040, with new cases expected to exceed 3 million annually (a 40% increase) and deaths to surpass 1 million (a 50% increase), highlighting the urgent need for advancements in detection and treatment. Current detection of metastasis is highly dependent on labour-intensive and error-prone pathological examination of large-scale biotissue. Given the high-resolution (100,000 × 100,000 gigapixels) but limited quantity of open-source pathological slide datasets, existing deep learning models face preprocessing challenges. This paper introduces HI-Net, a high-speed panoramic feature-extraction pyramid network for rapid and accurate detection of metastatic breast cancer, balancing panoramic segmentation and local attention. Additionally, a lightweight pathological slide dataset optimised for 512 x 512-pixel resolution, derived from downsampled and reassembled competitive datasets, accelerates training and reduces computational costs. HI-Net demonstrates superior performance on existing medical imaging competition datasets and our lightweight dataset, evidencing its effectiveness across datasets and potential for contributing to the generalisation of intelligent diagnostics. © 2024 The Author(s)."
"In addition to blood test data, inflammation-based prognostic markers have been used to predict the prognosis of various types of cancer. However, several of these previous studies may be outdated, as they were conducted prior to the widespread adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors, leading to limited reports on their efficacy. The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of different inflammation-based prognostic markers in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer undergoing nivolumab monotherapy as salvage-line chemotherapy. In a retrospective cohort study across Japan, a total of 159 patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer who were treated with nivolumab between September 2017 and March 2020 were selected. Blood test data were collected within 14 days of the start of chemotherapy and 17 inflammation-based prognostic markers were evaluated. Cox regression analysis was performed using all patient background factors. Subsequently, model selection was performed using backward elimination based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to obtain effective background factors which could be assessed for their impact on patient survival. For each marker, the magnitude of the impact on the survival rate, after adjusting for the background factors, was assessed using concordance and AIC analyses. A total of 159 patients (female, 30.2%; median age, 70 years) were included in the present study. Most patients received platinum, fluoropyrimidine and taxane treatment, with a median of three prior lines of systemic therapy. With a median follow-up of 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.5-3.8), median overall survival and time to treatment failure were 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.3-4.5) and 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.8-2.3), respectively. Amongst the 17 markers analyzed, the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) was classed as the most useful factor that affected the survival rate of patients. Real-world data showed that mGPS, an inflammation-based prognostic marker, had the strongest correlation with prognosis in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer receiving nivolumab monotherapy. The present study was registered as a clinical trial with the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm) under the trial registration number UMIN000050590 on 15th March 2023.

"Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is an uncommon yet clinically significant medical phenomenon characterized by dyspnea, a distressing symptom manifesting as breathlessness upon assuming an upright position, which notably improves upon reclining. In stark contrast to orthopnea, where dyspnea worsens in a supine position, POS uniquely presents with decreased blood oxygen saturation upon transitioning from lying down to standing up. This syndrome poses diagnostic challenges due to its subtle symptomatology and requires a high index of clinical suspicion for accurate identification. Herein, we present a case of a 79-year-old female with a complex medical history, notably encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE) necessitating long-term anticoagulation with warfarin, a history of breast cancer status post lumpectomy and chemotherapy, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient was admitted from a living facility with persistent hypoxemia and clinical features suggestive of POS. Despite comprehensive physical examination and routine laboratory investigations, no overt abnormalities were discerned. However, echocardiography unveiled a severe patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting, corroborating the diagnosis of POS. Subsequently, percutaneous closure of the PFO using the GORE CARDIOFORM septal occluder was performed, with fluoroscopy confirming successful device placement within the atrial septum. Remarkably, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in oxygenation post-procedure, prompting her discharge within 2 days. POS, though rare, holds substantial clinical significance owing to its potential to precipitate considerable morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiological basis of POS lies in the discordance between pulmonary and systemic blood flow, culminating in arterial desaturation upon assuming an upright posture. Timely recognition and intervention are imperative to mitigate symptom burden and avert the progression of associated complications. Early diagnosis facilitates the implementation of targeted therapeutic strategies, thereby alleviating dyspnea and forestalling adverse sequelae stemming from this syndrome. As such, heightened awareness among healthcare practitioners regarding the nuanced presentation of POS is paramount to expedite appropriate management and optimize patient outcomes.

"Among the 7.8 million women with breast cancer worldwide, at least 33% to 44% of them are affected by lymphatic pain. Lymphatic pain refers to co-occurring pain (e.g., pain, aching or soreness) and swelling. Pharmacological approaches, such as the uses of NSAIDS, opioids, antiepileptics, ketamine and lidocaine, have very limited effects on lymphatic pain. Limited research in this field has made it difficult for patients and clinicians to differentiate lymphatic pain from other types of pain. Precision assessment to distinguish different types of pain is essential for finding efficacious cure for pain. Innovative behavioral interventions to promote lymph flow and reduce inflammation are promising to reduce lymphatic pain. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of lymphatic pain through research evidence-based knowledge and insights into precision assessment and therapeutic behavioral intervention for lymphatic pain."

"Delays in initiating cancer treatment time to treatment initiation (TTI) can negatively impact patient outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the association between TTI and survival in breast, cervical and prostate cancer patients at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital (IALCH) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, as a microcosm of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We analyzed electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with breast, cervical or prostate cancer at IALCH between 2010 and 2020. Median TTI was calculated for different treatment modalities. To assess the link between treatment delay and mortality, we employed a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), treating breast cancer and patients over 40 as competing events. Additionally, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis and linear regression were used to compare TTI across racial groups. The study included patients with breast (44%), cervical (44%) and prostate cancer (12%). Mean age at diagnosis was 62.6, 56.6 and 73.0 years, respectively. Breast cancer patients experienced the longest delays for mastectomy (median 18.4 weeks), followed by prostate cancer patients waiting for radiotherapy (median 16.6 weeks). Significantly longer TTI for radiotherapy was observed in patients younger than 40 with cervical (HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 2.16-2.44,  p p p p p This study identified significant delays in treatment initiation (TTI) for breast, prostate and cervical cancer patients at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital (IALCH) in South Africa. These delays were concerning, particularly for younger patients and individuals across all racial backgrounds.

Furthermore, this study serves as a valuable model for future research throughout SSA to collectively address the challenges of treatment delays and improve cancer care for the region. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience."
"The Government of India (GOI) has launched a nationwide cervical, breast and oral cancer prevention and control program. However, the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), a nationwide survey conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), GOI, has shown concerning results on screening uptake by both men and women across India. This study was conducted to describe the uptake of cancer screening by women residing in Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India. We analyzed NFHS-5 data available in public domain to determine the number of women (aged 30-49 years) participating in cancer screening across the 71 districts in UP state. We utilized population projections for the year 2021 provided by the population projections for India and states for calculating the number of women. The district-wise estimation was done using a projection of district-level annual population. Although the GOI has made screening available for common cancers, NFHS-5 results indicated that the screening uptake among women aged 30-49 years is a cause for concern. The data revealed less than 1% of women underwent screening, and some of the districts showed no screening uptake. GOI has laid down a framework for cancer screening; however, poor participation among women calls for research to understand the barriers to cancer screening and to develop interventions to address these barriers. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience."

"Breast cancer is a common and complex disease, with various clinical features affecting prognosis. Accurate prediction of prognosis is essential for guiding personalized treatment strategies. This study aimed to develop machine learning models for predicting prognosis in breast cancer patients using retrospective data. A total of 6,477 patients from Affiliated Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital were included, and their electronic medical records (EMRs) were thoroughly examined to identify 15 clinical features significantly associated with breast cancer survival. We employed eight different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop and evaluate the predictive performance of the models. In addition, to investigate the sensitivity of different training/testing set radio to model performance, we examined five sets of ratios: 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10. Among these models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813, accuracy of 0.739, sensitivity of 0.815, and specificity of 0.735. Further statistical analysis identified several significant predictors of prognosis, including age, tumor size, lymph node status, and hormone receptor status. The XGBoost model was found to exhibit superior predictive power compared to established prognostic models such as the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and Predict Breast. Based on the successful performance of the XGBoost model, we developed a prognosis prediction tool specifically designed for breast cancer, providing valuable insights to clinicians, and aiding them in making informed treatment decisions tailored to individual patients. Our study highlights the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting prognosis for breast cancer patients, ultimately facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Further research and validation are warranted to fully integrate these models into clinical practice. 2024 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved."

"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. Established prognostic markers in breast carcinomas include tumor size, histologic grade, nodal status, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, hormone receptor status, HER-2 status, and age. To correlate peripheral tumor budding (pTB) with stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) and established prognostic factors in invasive breast carcinoma. It is a retrospective study conducted at multiple centers including a tertiary care center. 100 cases were included over a period of 2.5 years. All cases of invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) in which excision specimens with lymph node dissection were available were studied. Slides were reviewed for pTB and sTILs. Tumor budding of ≤20/10 hpf was considered low tumor budding, and >20 buds/10 hpf was considered high tumor budding. Tumor budding was correlated with age, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumor stage (pT, pN), stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor grade, ductal carcinoma in situ, hormonal receptors, and HER2neu. Fisher exact test and Chi-square test were used. We found that high tumor budding was seen in 34 cases and low tumor budding in 66 cases. There was a statistically significant association between high tumor budding and tumor size (P = 0.007), lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.001), perineural invasion (P = 0.004), tumor staging/pT (P = 0.006), nodal staging/pN (P = 0.001), and low sTILs (P < 0.001). However, the association of high tumor budding with parameters like age (P = 0.979), histological type (P = 0.243), tumor grade (P = 0.052), DCIS (P = 0.478), and ER (P = 0.633), and PR (P = 0.544), HER2Neu status (P = 0.171) was not significant. This study suggests tumor budding score can be used as a prognostic indicator for breast cancer. Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Indian Journal of Pathology and Microbiology."
"Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a common mammalian cell surface glycoprotein, is the major substrate of polysialic acid (polySia). Polysialylated NCAM occurs in many types of cancer, but rarely in normal adult tissues. The functional role of NCAM hypersialylation in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process remains unclear. The present study indicates that NCAM and attached polysialic acid affect behaviors of breast epithelial cells through differential signaling pathways. NCAM and polysialylated NCAM are aberrantly regulated in breast cancer cells. They are both upregulated in normal breast epithelial cells undergoing EMT. Western blot analysis demonstrates that NCAM-140 overexpression induces EMT in breast epithelial cells and promotes cell proliferation and migration through activation of the β-catenin/slug signaling pathway. Modification of polySia attached to NCAM modulates cell adhesion and promotes cell motility through activation of the EGFR/STAT3 pathway. These observations contribute to clarifying the molecular mechanisms by which polysialic acid and its major substrate, NCAM, modulate cell behaviors, and highlight the significance of increased polysialylated expression on NCAM during EMT and tumor development."

"The CRISPR-Cas systems are adopted as powerful molecular tools for not only genetic manipulation but also point-of-care diagnostics. However, methods to enable diagnostics of non-nucleic-acid targets with these systems are still limited. Herein, by fusing ligand-dependent allosteric ribozymes with CRISPR-Cas12a, a derived CRISPR-Cas system is created for efficient quantitative analysis of non-nucleic-acid targets in 1-2 h. On two different small molecules, the system's generality, reliability and accuracy is demonstrated, and show that the well operability of this system can enable high-throughput detection of a small molecule in blood samples. The system can be further converted to rely on allosteric deoxyribozyme instead of allosteric ribozyme to recognize non-nucleic-acid targets and transduce the signal to CRISPR-Cas12a for amplification, likely making it easier for storage and more consistent in data generation as DNA possess a stability advantage over RNA. This (deoxy)ribozyme-assisted CRISPR-Cas12a system anticipates that it can facilitate bioanalysis in various scientific and clinical settings and further drive the development of clinical translation. © 2024 Wiley‐VCH GmbH."
"With the advancement of computer technology and imaging equipment, ultrasound has emerged as a crucial tool in breast cancer diagnosis. To gain deeper insights into the research landscape of ultrasound in breast cancer diagnosis, this study employed bibliometric methods for a comprehensive analysis spanning from 2004 to 2024, analyzing 3523 articles from 2176 institutions in 82 countries/regions. Over this period, publications on ultrasound diagnosis of breast cancer showed a fluctuating growth trend from 2004 to 2024. Notably, China, Seoul National University and Kim EK emerged as leading contributors in ultrasound for breast cancer detection, with the most published and cited journals being Ultrasound Med Biol and Radiology. The research spots in this area included ""breast lesion"", ""dense breast"" and ""breast-conserving surgery"", while ""machine learning"", ""ultrasonic imaging"", ""convolutional neural network"", ""case report"", ""pathological complete response"", ""deep learning"", ""artificial intelligence"" and ""classification"" are anticipated to become future research frontiers.

"We examined neighborhood characteristics concerning breast cancer screening annual adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed 6673 female patients aged 40 or older at increased inherited cancer risk in 2 large health care systems (NYU Langone Health [NYULH] and the University of Utah Health [UHealth]). Multinomial models were used to identify predictors of mammogram screening groups (non-adherent, pre-pandemic adherent, pandemic period adherent) in comparison to adherent females. Potential determinants included sociodemographic characteristics and neighborhood factors. Comparing each cancer group in reference to the adherent group, a reduced likelihood of being non-adherent was associated with older age (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99), a greater number of relatives with cancer (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86), and being seen at NYULH study site (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.60). More relatives with cancer were correlated with a lesser likelihood of being pandemic period adherent (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97). A lower likelihood of being pre-pandemic adherent was seen in areas with less education (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.96) and NYULH study site (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.55). Finally, greater neighborhood deprivation (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.01) was associated with being non-adherent. Breast screening during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with being older, having more relatives with cancer, residing in areas with less educational attainment, and being seen at NYULH; non-adherence was linked with greater neighborhood deprivation. These findings may mitigate risk of clinically important screening delays at times of disruptions in a population at greater risk for breast cancer."
"Metastasis to the oral soft tissues and jaw is rare and accounts for 1%-3% of maxillofacial malignancies. These lesions usually occur in the context of an extensive malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. Archived cases from the Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Department of the Faculty of Dentistry and two hospital centers of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences were examined. Inclusion criteria were cases with available records of pathologically confirmed metastatic lesions of the oral cavity with or without diagnosed primary malignancy. Metastatic lesions in the oral cavity and jaw were found in 18 patients, including seven women and 11 men, with a mean age of 49.5 years. Metastatic lesions were more common in the jaw (66%) and particularly in the mandible (38%) than elsewhere. In the case of soft tissue metastases, the gingiva was more affected than other sites. The primary tumor was most commonly in the kidney in men and in the breast in women (36%-28%). In addition, the diagnosis of a metastatic lesion led to the detection of the primary tumor elsewhere in six out of 18 cases (33.3%). Early diagnosis of the lesions is challenging, given the absence of specific signs or symptoms, which, in some cases, nonetheless resemble inflammatory, benign, reactive lesions. Therefore, dentists play a crucial role in diagnosing such lesions, as they lead to the discovery of hidden distant primary tumors. Biopsy should always be considered for suspicious lesions, even if the probability is very low. © 2024 The Author(s). Clinical and Experimental Dental Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer involving skin lymphatics. Breast reconstruction traditionally has been delayed in IBC. Immediate reconstruction has been described in select patients. Studies evaluating the reconstructive and oncologic safety of immediate breast reconstruction in this patient population are limited and retrospective. The purpose of this study is to assess the current body of literature on immediate breast reconstruction in IBC patients to identify knowledge gaps. A scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Original articles that evaluated patients diagnosed with IBC who underwent immediate breast reconstruction were included. The search yielded 821 articles, of which 9 articles containing 1429 IBC patients were included for analysis. Immediate implant-based reconstruction occurred in 12.2% (174/1429) of patients. Immediate autologous reconstruction occurred in 19.0% (272/1429). Immediate reconstruction with both autologous and implant-based techniques was 4.5% (64/1429). Reconstruction type was not reported for 63.0% (899/1429) of patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 1.8% (26/1429) of patients. Local cancer recurrence was 14.3% (3/21) at 18.9 months. The mortality rate was 32.4% (131/404) at 22 months. Performance of immediate breast reconstruction can be safely performed from a reconstructive standpoint in select patients. © 2024 The Author(s).
