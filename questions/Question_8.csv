Abstract
"Pediatric neurosurgical practice is prevalent in most low- and lower-middle-income countries but lacks comprehensive documentation of practice patterns, demographics, and case variety. This study aimed to present the current state of pediatric neurosurgery in Ethiopia, including workforce characterization, case variety, and relevant procedures. A survey was developed and distributed to all Ethiopian fully trained neurosurgeons (n = 50). Survey questions assessed sociodemographic variables, level of training, case variety, and neurosurgical practice. Statistical analysis was conducted to describe the current practice of pediatric neurosurgery. A total of 45 neurosurgeons responded (90%). Three respondents (7%) were women. There was only 1 fellowship-trained pediatric neurosurgeon, while most neurosurgeons were general neurosurgeons who served a pediatric patient population. Most neurosurgeons (56%) worked in the capital city, Addis Ababa, while another 13% worked in other urban settings. The top three indications for a pediatric neurosurgical procedure were neural tube defects (NTDs) (96%), hydrocephalus (93%), and trauma (60%). NTD-associated hydrocephalus was the most common hydrocephalus type seen (71%). The most common procedure for hydrocephalus was shunt insertion (96%). A prenatal diagnosis of NTD was made in < 10% of cases, as reported by 84% of respondents. The study highlights Ethiopia's need for more pediatric neurosurgeons. Suggested strategies to facilitate subspecialty training include the establishment of a fellowship program facilitated by the implementation of a nationwide pediatric neurosurgery registry. Promoting efforts for early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric conditions coupled with NTD prevention initiatives could improve pediatric neurosurgical care in Ethiopia."
"Posttraumatic osteoarthritis is a common indication for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between a history of patella fracture and postoperative complication rates after TKA. Patients diagnosed with a patella fracture before undergoing TKA were identified from a large national database and matched to a control cohort using propensity scoring. Rates of medical complications occurring within 90 days of TKA and surgery-related complications occurring within 1 year of TKA were compared using odds ratios. Healthcare utilization outcomes including 90-day emergency department (ED) presentation, hospital readmission, and total cost were also compared. Compared with a propensity-matched control cohort, TKA patients with a history of patella fracture had a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism (OR 0.74, P = 0.0442) and higher incidences of periprosthetic joint infection (OR 1.68, P < 0.0001), revision surgery (OR 1.84, P < 0.0001), dislocation (OR 1.61, P = 0.026), lysis of adhesions (OR 2.21, P = 0.0082), and wound disruption (OR 1.52, P < 0.0001). A history of patella fracture was also associated with an increased rate of ED presentation (OR 1.08, P = 0.0454) and increased total cost ($14,359 vs. $12,786, P = 0.0003). A history of patella fracture is associated with early surgery-related complications after TKA including periprosthetic joint infection, revision surgery, dislocation, lysis of adhesions, and wound disruption. Healthcare utilization is increased among these patients with higher rates of ED presentation and increased total cost. These findings allow for more accurate risk stratification and counseling of patients. III, Retrospective review. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

"Delay in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is thought to be a major cause of its poor outcomes. We evaluated the delays within the presentation to the initiation of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions amongst lung cancer patients in Southern Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2019 to March 2021. The data collected through interview included socio-demographic, medical and clinical findings, and the time intervals needed to visit physician, refer to specialist, request diagnostic procedures, reach diagnosis of lung cancer, and hospitalization. Eighty-nine patients (58 males and 31 females) with a mean age of 61.01 ± 12.25 years were included. The median time of symptom presentation and first physician visit interval was 25 days. Sixty-five days were spent for requesting, performing, and evaluating the diagnostic procedures. The median interval between diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 16 days. Totally, it took an average of 122 days from the presentation to the definite diagnosis of lung cancer. Patient-, diagnosis-, and treatment-related delays were not significantly correlated with any of the demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical (disease stage, symptom) variables, as well as the diagnosis tool and the first physician who visited the patient (p > 0.05). There was a significant delay but relatively similar to other countries in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients in Southern Iran. The largest portion of delay could be attributed to the raising clinical suspicion in the physicians, referral for diagnostic assessments, and the diagnosis process. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Optical imaging is a powerful tool for early disease detection and effective treatment planning, but its accuracy is often compromised by the uptake of imaging materials by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Herein, we leverage multivalent host-guest interactions between cyanine dyes and β-cyclodextrin polymers to develop supramolecular probes with enhanced stability, optical, and transport profiles for accurate in vivo imaging. These multivalent interactions not only ensure the stability of the probes but also enhance fluorescence efficiency by minimizing nonradiative decay. Our self-assembly approach effectively modulates probe size and surface properties, enabling evasion of MPS clearance and promoting prolonged bloodstream circulation, thereby improving the signal-to-background ratio for imaging. The effectiveness of our design is demonstrated by substantial advancements in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury and by providing high-contrast imaging and precise surgical navigation across various tumor models. Our strategy not only advances optical imaging materials toward clinical translation but also establishes a versatile platform applicable to multiple imaging modalities."
"Successful acute migraine treatment potentially prevents emergency room (ER) consultations but requires that the diagnosis of migraine was given earlier. The aim of this study is to quantify the problem of missed migraine diagnosis prior to ER visits. Inclusion criterion for this single-center prospective study was the presentation at the ER for acute headache. Patients with acute migraine attacks were assessed for previous migraine attacks, and whether they were given a diagnosis of migraine in the past. Of 137 patients with migraine diagnosis at discharge, 108 (79%) had previous headache attacks fulfilling the criteria for migraine according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3). Of those, 54 (50%) received the diagnosis for the first time. Half of the migraine patients (50%) presenting in the ER for headache could have been diagnosed earlier. This highlights the need for better detection and treatment of migraine by pre-hospital healthcare providers, as earlier diagnosis and specific acute treatment could have prevented the ER visit.

"Masses in the forefoot and midfoot are common reasons for medical presentation and can be caused by various pathological conditions. The challenge in clinical practice is to distinguish the multitude of trivialities from the few malignant entities and to arrive at a reliable clinical diagnosis in a reasonable amount of time with a moderate use of diagnostic tools. In a retrospective analysis, tumors, tumor-like lesions, and pseudotumors distal to the Chopart joint presented to our multidisciplinary university tumor board between January 2010 und June 2023 were analyzed concerning entity, location, age, and sex. Of the 167 cases included, 18 were osseous and 149 were soft tissue lesions. Overall, the metatarsal region was most frequently affected, accounting for 42.5% of all cases. Osseous lesions showed a preference for the phalanges and soft-tissue lesions occurring more frequently in the metatarsal region. In total, 88.0% of all cases were benign. All 20 malignant cases derived from soft tissue, occurred in all sections of the forefoot and midfoot and comprised 13 entities. Most lesions affected middle-aged patients, but cases occurred in almost every age group. In the examined patient population of a German university hospital, most cases were benign soft tissue lesions with a substantial share of pseudotumors and tumor-like lesions. However, the malignancy rate of 12.0% highlights the importance of differential diagnostic considerations. In cases of uncertain results, it is crucial to refer individuals with unclear masses to a specialized center for musculoskeletal tumor care early on in their treatment process. III"
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent complication of liver transplantation, leading to prolonged hospital or intensive care unit stay and significant morbidity. Recently, biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C have been investigated for their potential role in the early detection of AKI in liver transplantation patients. Our study comprised 60 patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing living donor liver transplantation. Based on the postoperative development of AKI, the patients were categorised into two groups: the AKI group comprising 22 patients and the non-AKI group comprising 38 patients. Serum cystatin C and urine NGAL levels were measured twice: immediately after induction of anaesthesia (baseline) and at the end of the surgery. The overall incidence of AKI was 36.66%. The mean cystatin C level measured at the end of the surgery was significantly higher in the AKI group (1.12 ± 0.40 mg/L) than in the non-AKI group (0.82 ± 0.27 mg/L) [P = .001]. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the postoperative cystatin C biomarker demonstrated a significant difference between the AKI and non-AKI groups [area under the curve: 0.71, P = .007]. However, baseline cystatin C and urine NGAL levels did not significantly differ between the groups. Cystatin C levels measured at the end of the surgery showed a better predictive value and higher accuracy in identifying post-liver transplantation patients with AKI than baseline cystatin C and urine NGAL."
"Despite the significant decline in the incidence of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (AKI) in recent decades due to advancements in medicine and increased awareness of this disease, it remains an important risk factor for maternal morbidity and mortality. However, as fertilization techniques allow women of advanced age to become pregnant, the incidence of pregnancy-related AKI has increased. Consequently, early identification of and intervention for pregnancy-related AKI are particularly important. This was a retrospective clinical analysis. Data were collected from pregnant patients who were treated in the ICU of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2014 to June 2020; The patients were divided into two groups based on their kidney function status: AKI and non-AKI. Additionally, they were further categorized into recovered and non-recovered groups based on their prognosis. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and the chi-square test were used for multigroup comparisons, while logistic regression analysis was used for the analysis of risk factors. P < .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference in all correlation analyses. Among 874 pregnant women in this study, 136 had AKI (15.56%), while 36 developed chronic renal insufficiency (26.47%). Statistically significant associations were shown for shock (P = .002), sepsis (P < .001), coagulopathies (P = .001), liver insufficiency (P < .001), postpartum hemorrhage (P = .016), intrauterine fetal death (P = .042) and mechanical ventilation (P = .006) between the AKI-group and the non-AKI group. The development of AKI based on an elevated baseline creatinine level was significantly related to the outcome of renal function (P < .001), while a significant difference was shown in the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) between the recovery group and the non-recovery group (P = .023). We identified the relevant risk factors leading to pregnancy-related AKI and affecting the patients' prognosis. Shock, sepsis, coagulation disorders, liver insufficiency, postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine fetal death and mechanical ventilation are independent risk factors for pregnancy-related AKI, while an elevated baseline creatine level is a key factor for poor prognosis. Meanwhile, early CRRT can effectively reverse renal outcomes."
"Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy presents an important downstaging option with lower toxicity than neoadjuvant chemotherapy in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive early breast cancer. Meta-analysis of the effects of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy on surgical outcomes across randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies has not previously been performed. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy on surgical outcomes (PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews, 2020)) compared with surgery followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify RCT and cohort studies between 1946 and 27 March 2024. Two independent reviewers manually screened the identified records and extracted the data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tools and random-effects meta-analysis was done with ReviewManager. The search identified 2390 articles eligible for screening. The review included 20 studies (12 cohort and 8 RCTs); 19 were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 6382 patients. Overall, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with a lower mastectomy rate compared with surgery first (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% c.i. 0.44 to 0.64). Subgroup analysis showed similar improvement in the mastectomy rate in the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy group versus control group irrespective of study type (RCT: RR 0.58, 95% c.i. 0.50 to 0.66; cohorts: RR 0.48, 95% c.i. 0.33 to 0.70). There was no difference in the mastectomy rate by duration of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (more than 4 months: RR 0.57, 95% c.i. 0.42 to 0.78; 4 months or less than 4 months: RR 0.52, 95% c.i. 0.43 to 0.64). Most of the studies were characterized by moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is associated with a reduction in mastectomy rate. Given the moderate methodological quality of previous studies, further RCTs are required. CRD42020209257. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of BJS Foundation Ltd."
"Auxiliary diagnosis of different types of cystic lung diseases (CLDs) is important in the clinic and is instrumental in facilitating early and specific treatments. Current clinical methods heavily depend on accumulated experience, restricting their applicability in regions with less developed medical resources. Thus, how to realize the computer-aided diagnosis of CLDs is of great clinical value. This work proposed a deep learning-based method for automatically segmenting the lung parenchyma in computed tomography (CT) slice images and accurately diagnosing the CLDs using CT scans. A two-stage deep learning method was proposed for the automatic classification of normal cases and five different CLDs using CT scans. Lung parenchyma segmentation is the foundation of CT image analysis and auxiliary diagnosis. To meet the requirements of different sizes of the lung parenchyma, an adaptive region-growing and improved U-Net model was employed for mask acquisition and automatic segmentation. The former was achieved by a self-designed adaptive seed point selection method based on similarity measurement, and the latter introduced multiscale input and multichannel output into the original U-Net model and effectively achieved the lightweight design by adjusting the structure and parameters. After that, the middle 30 consecutive CT slice images of each sample were segmented to obtain lung parenchyma, which was employed for training and testing the proposed multichannel parallel input recursive MLP-Mixer network (MPIRMNet) model, achieving the computer-aided diagnosis of CLDs. A total of 4718 and 16 290 CT slice images collected from 543 patients were employed to validate the proposed segmentation and classification methods, respectively. Experimental results showed that the improved U-Net model can accurately segment the lung parenchyma in CT slice images, with the Dice, precision, volumetric overlap error, and relative volume difference of 0.96 ± 0.01, 0.93 ± 0.04, 0.05 ± 0.02, and 0.05 ± 0.03, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed MPIRMNet model achieved appreciable classification effect for normal cases and different CLDs, with the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of 0.8823 ± 0.0324, 0.8897 ± 0.0325, 0.9746 ± 0.0078, and 0.8831 ± 0.0334, respectively. Compared with classical machine learning and convolutional neural networks-based methods for this task, the proposed classification method had a preferable performance, with a significant improvement of accuracy of 10.74%. The work introduced a two-stage deep learning method, which can achieve the segmentation of lung parenchyma and the classification of CLDs. Compared to previous diagnostic tasks targeting single CLD, this work can achieve various CLDs' diagnosis in the early stage, thereby achieving targeted treatment and increasing the potential and value of clinical applications. © 2024 American Association of Physicists in Medicine."
"Osteoarthritis is more prevalent and severe among women than among men, but women are less likely to access early diagnosis and first-line management, particularly racialized immigrant women. Previous research advocated for greater access to culturally safe osteoarthritis information for both diverse women and health care professionals. The internet can reduce disparities by facilitating access to health information, but online materials can vary in quality. This study aimed to assess the quality and cultural safety of online osteoarthritis materials for persons affected by osteoarthritis and health care professionals. Content analysis was used to describe publicly available materials on osteoarthritis first-line management developed by Canadian organizations for affected persons or health care professionals. Searching, screening, and data extraction were performed in triplicate. We identified materials by searching Google, MEDLINE, and references of osteoarthritis-relevant guidelines and policies, and consulting our research team and collaborators. We assessed quality using DISCERN (University of Oxford) and a compiled framework for affected persons and health care professionals. We compiled frameworks to assess cultural safety. We derived an overall score, categorized as low (<50%), moderate (50%-69%), or high (≥70%+) for criteria met. After screening 176 items and eliminating 129, we included 47 osteoarthritis materials published between 2013 and 2023. Of those, 43 were for persons with osteoarthritis, most were developed by charities (n=31, 72.1%), based on expert advice (n=16, 55.2%), and in the format of booklets (n=15, 34.9%) or text on web pages (n=10, 23.3%). Of those, 23.3% (10/43) low, 46.5% (20/43) moderate, and 30.2% (13/43) high scored quality; and 25.6% (11/43), 48.8% (21/43), and 25.6% (11/43) were rated low, moderate, and high cultural safety, respectively. Of the 47 included osteoarthritis materials, 4 were for health care professionals. They were developed by a consortium (2/4, 50%), a charity (1/4, 25%), and a professional society (1/4, 25%), and largely based on expert advice (3/4, 75%). The format included infographics (3/4, 75%) and text on web pages (1/4, 25%). Of those, 25% (1/4), 25% (1/4), and 50% (2/4) were rated low, moderate, and high quality, respectively; and all were rated low for cultural safety. Quality and cultural safety did not appear to be associated with the characteristics of osteoarthritis materials (eg, type of developer, development method, and format). Overall, included osteoarthritis materials for persons with osteoarthritis and health care professionals were of low to moderate quality and cultural safety. These findings reveal the need for further efforts to improve existing or develop new osteoarthritis materials for both affected persons, including ethnoculturally diverse immigrant women, and health care professionals. Further research is needed to assess the quality and cultural safety of osteoarthritis materials developed by organizations outside of Canada and to establish a framework or instrument to assess cultural safety in the osteoarthritis context. ©Smita Dhakal, Shermeen Merani, Vandana Ahluwalia, Marisa Battistella, Cornelia M Borkhoff, Glen Stewart Hazlewood, Aisha Lofters, Deborah A Marshall, Crystal MacKay, Anna R Gagliardi.

"The integration of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has revolutionized the landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and therapeutic interventions. By combining structural and functional imaging, PET/CT provides a comprehensive understanding of disease pathology and response to treatment assessment. PET/CT, particularly with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), facilitates the visualization of glucose metabolism in the brain, enabling early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of neurodegenerative disease progression. The advent of amyloid and tau PET imaging has further propelled the field forward, offering invaluable tools for tracking pathological hallmarks, assessing treatment response, and predicting clinical outcomes. While some therapeutic interventions targeting amyloid plaque load showed promising results with the reduction of cerebral amyloid accumulation over time, others failed to demonstrate a significant impact of anti-amyloid agents for reducing the amyloid plaques burden in AD brains. Tau PET imaging has conversely fueled the advent of disease-modifying therapeutic strategies in AD by supporting the assessment of neurofibrillary tangles of tau pathology deposition over time. Looking ahead, PET imaging holds immense promise for studying additional targets such as neuroinflammation, cholinergic deficit, and synaptic dysfunction. Advances in radiotracer development, dedicated brain PET/CT scanners, and Artificial Intelligence-powered software are poised to enhance the quality, sensitivity, and diagnostic power of molecular neuroimaging. Consequently, PET/CT remains at the forefront of AD research, offering unparalleled opportunities for unravelling the complexities of the disease and advancing therapeutic interventions, although it is not yet enough alone to allow patients' recruitment in therapeutic clinical trials."
"With the advent of PET imaging in 1976, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-PET became the preferred method for in vivo investigation of cerebral processes, including regional hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease. With the emergence of amyloid-PET tracers, [11C]Pittsburgh Compound-B in 2004 and later [18F]florbetapir, [18F]florbetaben, and [18F]flumetamol, amyloid-PET has replaced FDG-PET in Alzheimer's disease anti-amyloid clinical trial treatments to ensure ""amyloid positivity"" as an entry criterion, and to measure treatment-related decline in cerebral amyloid deposits. MRI has been used to rule out other brain diseases and screen for 'amyloid-related imaging abnormalities' (ARIAs) of two kinds, ARIA-E and ARIA-H, characterized by edema and micro-hemorrhage, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, to measure changes in cerebral volumes. While early immunotherapy trials of Alzheimer's disease showed no clinical effects, newer monoclonal antibody trials reported decreases of 27% to 85% in the cerebral amyloid-PET signal, interpreted by the Food and Drug Administration as amyloid removal expected to result in a reduction in clinical decline. However, due to the lack of diagnostic specificity of amyloid-PET tracers, amyloid positivity cannot prevent the inclusion of non-Alzheimer's patients and even healthy subjects in these clinical trials. Moreover, the ""decreasing amyloid accumulation"" assessed by amyloid-PET imaging has questionable quantitative value in the presence of treatment-related brain damage (ARIAs). Therefore, future Alzheimer's clinical trials should disregard amyloid-PET imaging and focus instead on assessment of regional brain function by FDG-PET and MRI monitoring of ARIAs and brain volume loss in all trial patients."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in patient demographics over 65 years old causing debilitating cognitive impairment. Most commonly, AD is diagnosed clinically as ""probable AD"", and definitive diagnosis is confirmed through postmortem brain autopsies to detect extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. The exact mechanism causing AD is still unknown, but treatments for AD have been actively investigated. Currently, immunotherapies have shown substantial promise in reducing the pathologic and clinical signs of AD. This review aims to evaluate passive immunotherapies deemed to have promise for further development and use in the treatment of AD. Immunotherapies were selected via a narrative review of medications that have potential clinical effectiveness with a status of FDA accepted, FDA fast-track, FDA status pending, or emerging therapies poised to pursue FDA approval. This review has yielded two anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that are currently fully FDA approved, one mAb granted FDA fast-track status, two therapies on hold, three discontinued medications, and three promising emerging therapies. We conclude that, in the near future, passive immunotherapies will be the preferred and evidence-based method of treatment for AD with the presence of brain Aβ deposits for both symptom management and potential slowing of disease progression. Specifically, lecanemab and donanemab will require further clinical studies to optimize patient selection based on safety profiles. Despite some key limitations, these two drugs are paving the way for disease-modifying treatments in patients displaying early signs of amyloid pathology."
"Despite an increase in maternal prenatal cannabis use and associations with adverse neonatal outcomes, research on child neurodevelopmental outcomes is limited. To evaluate the association between maternal cannabis use in early pregnancy and child autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This population-based retrospective birth cohort study included children born between 2011 and 2019 to pregnant Kaiser Permanente Northern California members screened for prenatal cannabis use during pregnancy. Statistical analysis was conducted February 2023 to March 2024. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was assessed at entrance to prenatal care (approximately 8- to 10-weeks' gestation) via self-report and/or positive urine toxicology test. Use frequency was assessed. Child ASD was defined by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes ascertained from the electronic health record. Associations between maternal prenatal cannabis use and child ASD were modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for maternal sociodemographic, other substance use and disorders, prenatal care initiation, comorbidities, and clustering among maternal siblings. The study cohort included 178 948 singleton pregnancies among 146 296 unique pregnant individuals, including 48 880 (27.3%) Asian or Pacific Islander, 42 799 (23.9%) Hispanic, 9742 (5.4%) non-Hispanic Black, and 70 733 (39.5%) non-Hispanic White pregnancies. The median (IQR) maternal age at pregnancy onset was 31 (6) years; 8486 (4.7%) screened positive for cannabis use, 7054 (3.9%) via urine toxicology testing and 3662 (2.0%) by self-report. In the total study population, the frequency of self-reported use was monthly or less for 2003 pregnancies (1.1%), weekly for 918 pregnancies (0.5%), daily for 741 pregnancies (0.4%), and unknown for 4824 pregnancies (2.7%). ASD was diagnosed in 3.6% of children. After adjustment for maternal characteristics, maternal prenatal cannabis use was not associated with child ASD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.32). When self-reported frequency of use was assessed, no statistically significant associations were observed after confounder adjustment. No sex-specific associations were documented (males: HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.77-1.32; and females: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.77-1.85). In this cohort study, maternal cannabis use assessed in early pregnancy was not associated with child ASD. Additional studies are needed to evaluate different patterns of use throughout pregnancy. Given the known adverse neonatal health effects of maternal prenatal cannabis use, clinicians should follow national guidelines and advise against use."
"There is an unmet need for effective topical therapies for patients with uremic xerosis and chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP). The long-term efficacy and tolerability of an emollient containing glycerol 15% and paraffin 10% (V0034CR) was evaluated in a phase 3 study. In this randomized, double-blind, two-parallel group, vehicle-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe uremic xerosis were randomized to once-daily application of V0034CR or vehicle control for 28 days (period I). This was followed by a treatment-free period of ≤ 21 days (period II), then all patients received open-label treatment with V0034CR for ≥ 84 days (period III). Outcomes included treatment response at the end of period I (El Gammal's xerosis severity score), instrumental measures of scaling (D-Squame technique), time to relapse during period II, rate of recurrence during period III, pruritus severity over time, patient acceptability, and adverse events (AEs). The intent-to-treat population comprised 235 patients randomized to V0034CR (n = 118) or vehicle control (n = 117) during period I. Treatment response at the end of period I was achieved by 71 patients (60.2%) in the V0034CR group versus 48 (41.0%) with vehicle control (p = 0.0041). This coincided with greater reductions in the total surface area of squames (p = 0.001 vs vehicle control). Xerosis relapsed progressively without treatment in period II; however, remission was durable under maintenance therapy in period III. Improvements in pruritus severity were comparable between V0034CR and vehicle control, suggesting that the antipruritic effect of V0034CR was mainly exerted by its oil-in-water emulsion base. V0034CR had high patient acceptability and was well tolerated; the most common treatment-related AEs were irritation or erythema (2.1%), exacerbated pruritus (1.3%), and vesicles at the application site (0.9%). These data support the use of V0034CR, with its hydrating and occlusive properties, for the long-term management of patients with moderate-to-severe uremic xerosis and CKD-aP.

"Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is a subtype of pancreatic cancer with a poorer prognosis than pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC). The pathogenesis of this histological subtype has not been fully explained due to its rarity. Of the 245 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer, six (2.3%) were diagnosed with PASC. They were retrospectively allocated to Group A (≥ 50% adenocarcinoma components) or Group S (≥ 50% squamous cell carcinoma components). The six patients with PASC were all males between the ages of 63 and 77 years, with tumors of 12 to 52 mm in diameter. Tumors were located in the pancreatic head (n = 2) and the pancreatic tail (n = 4). Relative to Group A, all three patients in Group S had larger tumors diameters, ≥ 40 mm with invasion to other organs. Cancer-specific survival of Group S was worse than that of the PDAC group (median survival, 1.5 years vs. 4.1 years). All patients in Group A were alive at the end of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival of Group S was inferior to that of the PDAC group (median survival, 0.2 years vs. 1.8 years; Group A, not defined). Immunohistochemistry revealed the MIB-1 positivity rate in squamous cell carcinoma regions was 1.8 times higher than that in adenocarcinoma regions in the same specimens. In PASC patients, an increased proportion of squamous cell carcinoma components was associated with aggressive behavior and a worse prognosis. This was due to the high MIB-1 positivity rate of squamous cell carcinoma components. © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a widespread neurobehavioral disorder affecting children and adolescents, requiring early detection for effective treatment. EEG connectivity measures can reveal the interdependencies between EEG recordings, highlighting brain network patterns and functional behavior that improve diagnostic accuracy. This study introduces a novel ADHD diagnostic method by combining linear and nonlinear brain connectivity maps with an attention-based convolutional neural network (Att-CNN). Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Phase-Locking Value (PLV) are used to create fused connectivity maps (FCMs) from various EEG frequency subbands, which are then inputted into the Att-CNN. The attention module is strategically placed after the latest convolutional layer in the CNN. The performance of different optimizers (Adam and SGD) and learning rates are assessed. The suggested model obtained 98.88%, 98.41%, 98.19%, and 98.30% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score, respectively, using the SGD optimizer in the FCM of the theta band with a learning rate of 1e-1. With the use of FCM, Att-CNN, and advanced optimizers, the proposed technique has the potential to produce trustworthy instruments for the early diagnosis of ADHD, greatly enhancing both patient outcomes and diagnostic accuracy. © 2024.

"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors threatening human beings and has a poor prognosis. Therefore, exploring unveiled biomarkers or therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of GC is crucial. A total of 5772 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) were aggregated from four latest large-scale proteomics cohorts. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (two-sample MR) was utilized to identify the causal effect of blood plasma proteins on GC. Heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and directionality analyses were employed to evaluate proteins identified via two-sample MR. The robustness of results was further validated via colocalization. The drug targets of proteins were evaluated to reveal the compounds that can interfere with these proteins. Ten proteins with potential causations in relation to GC were identified: LY6D, SLURP1, MLN, PSCA, THSD1, CFTR, PPM1B, KDM3A, TSC1, and HCG22. Among these proteins, LY6D, SLURP1, and THSD1 were considered as the most reliable biomarkers of GC due to their significant H4 posterior probabilities in colocalization analysis and absence of pleiotropy. Compound 35, nitrosamide, and 0175029-0000 were potential drugs or small molecules targeting LY6D, SLURP1, and THSD1, respectively. This study identified several plasma proteins as potential biomarkers of GC and provided data support and new insights into the early diagnosis, intervention, and therapeutic targets of GC. © 2024.

"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of anus is an uncommon neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. In most of the cases, early diagnosis of this disease is difficult since its symptoms frequently mimic benign inflammatory conditions. A systematic PubMed and Scopus search was conducted, a propos of a case report. One hundred fifty patients from 93 case reports were included. The mean age of the patients was 60.5 years (range: 18-81). The majority of them were males (124 out of 150, 82.7%), while the main known risk factor was the history of chronic fistula (109 out of 150, 72.7%). Recurrent perianal sepsis and perianal pain were the principal symptoms at the time of presentation. No symptoms have been reported only in three patients (3 out of 150, 2%). Regarding the prior surgical history of the patients, multiple abscess drainage and perianal fistula's related interventions were present in 62 (41.3%) and 19 (12.7%) patients, respectively. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was administered in 53 out of 150 patients (35.3%), while the majority of them have been treated with combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. APR and its variations were the most applied surgical treatment (68%). Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was administered almost up to one-third of the included patients (34%). Recurrence of the disease was reported in 41 out of 150 patients (27.3%). Death was reported in 44 out of 150 patients (29.3%). Review of the available published literature suggests that perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma is an extremely rare neoplasia. Τhere is no consensus as far as the diagnosis and the treatment strategies, due to the rarity of this neoplasm. High degree of clinical suspicion as well as histopathological confirmation is the principal requisites for the diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma, especially in the ground of chronic ulcero-proliferative perianal lesions. © 2024.

"Chronotype is an inherent physiological trait reflecting an individual's subjective preference for their sleep awakening time, exerting a substantial influence on both physical and mental well-being. While existing research has established a close relationship between chronotype and individual brain structure, prior studies have predominantly focused on individual measurements of brain structural scales, thereby limiting the exploration of the underlying mechanisms of structural changes. This study seeks to validate previous research findings and enhance our understanding of the correlation between circadian rhythm preference and diverse cortical indicators in healthy young individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and chronotype assessments were conducted once for all participants, comprising 49 late chronotype (LC) young adults and 49 matched early chronotype young adults. The Chronotype Questionnaire was utilized to assess morningness and eveningness preferences. Surface-based analysis of structural MRI data revealed that LC young adults exhibited thinner cortical thickness of left pars orbitalis and lower cortical mean curve of right paracentral gyrus. Overall, this study represents a significant advancement in elucidating the connection between brain structure and function within the context of chronotypes. © 2024.

"Many consider white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) to be important imaging findings in neuroborreliosis. However, evidence regarding association with WMHs is of low quality. The objective was to investigate WMHs in neuroborreliosis visually and quantitatively. Patients underwent brain MRI within one month of diagnosis and six months after treatment. Healthy controls were recruited. WMHs were counted by visual rating and the volume was calculated from automatic segmentation. Biochemical markers and scores for clinical symptoms and findings were used to explore association with longitudinal volume change of WMHs. The study included 74 patients (37 males) with early neuroborreliosis and 65 controls (30 males). Mean age (standard deviation) was 57.4 (13.5) and 57.7 (12.9) years, respectively. Baseline WMH lesion count was zero in 14 patients/16 controls, < 10 in 36/31, 10-20 in 9/7 and > 20 in 13/11, with no difference between groups (p = 0.90). However, from baseline to follow-up the patients had a small reduction in WMH volume and the controls a small increase, median difference 0.136 (95% confidence interval 0.051-0.251) ml. In patients, volume change was not associated with biochemical or clinical markers, but with degree of WMHs (p values 0.002-0.01). WMH lesions were not more numerous in patients with neuroborreliosis compared to healthy controls. However, there was a small reduction of WMH volume from baseline to follow-up among patients, which was associated with higher baseline WMH severity, but not with disease burden or outcome. Overall, non-specific WMHs should not be considered suggestive of neuroborreliosis. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Growing skull fracture (GSF) of the orbital roof is a rare complication of head injury in infancy and early childhood. Analysis of the Medline database between 1983 and 2023 identified 17 articles describing 63 children after surgical treatment of GSF of the orbital roof. We present a 2-year-old child with moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) complicated by GSF of the orbital roof. Neuroimaging and literature data are described. Severe ophthalmological symptoms in acute period of TBI subsequently partially regressed with persistent swelling of the upper eyelid and hypophthalmos. CT and MRI revealed a linear fracture of the frontal bone extending to superior orbital wall and intraorbital collection of cerebrospinal fluid (pseudomeningocele) mixed with blood. MR signs of GSF of the orbital roof with pseudomeningocele shrinkage were found in 5 weeks after injury. After 6 months, CT and MRI revealed signs of more severe GSF. Surgical treatment implied craniotomy, excision of scars, arachnoid membrane and abnormal brain matter, resection of deformed fracture edges, dura mater sealing and orbital roof reconstruction with bone autograft. Ophthalmological symptoms regressed after 6 months. The follow-up period was 6 years. There were no signs of fracture recurrence. In this case, acute intraorbital pseudomeningocele led to GSF of the orbital roof in 5 weeks after injury. Incomplete regression of ophthalmological symptoms, their aggravation or delayed appearance in children with orbital roof fracture requires a thorough examination including high-resolution CT and MRI, and orbital roof GSF should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
"Cerebral aneurysms are diagnosed in 1-5% of people and cause 80-85% of subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH). Aneurysmal hemorrhages are more common in people aged 30-50 years causing high socio-economic significance of this disease. Therefore, the outcomes of microsurgical clipping are an urgent problem in these patients. To evaluate the immediate and long-term results after microsurgical treatment of cerebral aneurysms in acute period of hemorrhage; to analyze functional results and long-term outcomes, including higher mental functions and return to previous work. The study included 517 patients in acute period of subarachnoid hemorrhage between 2019 and 2022. Severity of hemorrhage was assessed using the Hunt-Hess scale while the Fisher scale was valuable to estimate dimensions of hemorrhage and predictions for vasospasm. All patients underwent microsurgical clipping of aneurysms. We assessed clinical status and outcomes immediately after microsurgical clipping, within 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The Modified Glasgow Outcome Scale, Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), EQ-5D-3L Quality of Life Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination MMSE and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were used. After 1 month, mRS score 0 was observed in 22% of patients, score 1 - 17%, score 2 - 19.4%, score 3 - 6.2%, score 4 - 2.6%, score 5 - 1% of patients. Mortality rate was 6.4%. After 12 months, mRS score 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 was observed in 67%, 15%, 8%, 3% and 0.4% of patients, respectively. After 12 months, 39 (8.3%) patients did not return to previous work. Among 427 (91.7%) patients who returned to previous work, 20% returned to work after 3 months, 65% after 6 months and 15% after 9 months. Short-term and long-term functional outcomes vary significantly. There were significantly better mRS scores in long-term period compared to early period. Analysis of immediate and long-term results after hemorrhage will allow us to determine the most important predictors of adverse functional outcomes, assess the prevalence, characteristics, modifiable risk factors and consequences of hemorrhage."
"To investigate the effect of two fractionation regimens on survival in patients with Grade IV gliomas depending on rapid early progression (REP). Fractionation with prescribed doses of 2 and 3 Gy was alternately used in 140 patients with morphologically confirmed Grade IV glioma using a pairwise modeling strategy. REP was diagnosed in 60 (42.9%) out of 140 patients with Grade IV gliomas and 55 (45.5%) out of 121 patients with glioblastomas. Fatal outcome was observed in 111 (79.3%) patients, 99 (70.7%) ones died from progression of glioma. In case of no REP, the median overall survival as of December 2023 was 32.20 (95% CI 25.7-38.7) months, with REP - only 16.03 (95% CI 13.5-18.6) months ( p p In patients with Grade IV gliomas and no REP, 3 Gy ( n n p p p p p In patients with grade 4 gliomas and REP, 3 Gy ( n n p p p p p In patients with Grade IV gliomas and no REP, 3 Gy fractionation regimen has significant advantages over standard radiotherapy regarding overall survival.

"Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is highly prevalent in athletes. The objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of daily tangeretin combined with whey protein supplementation over a period of 4 weeks in professional athletes with EIB. Using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, paired, randomized trial design, a cohort of 30 professional athletes with EIB, consisting of 14 females and 16 males, was divided into two groups: the tangeretin combined with whey protein intervention group (TIG), and the placebo control group (PCG).

"Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a complex and potentially fatal hypersensitivity condition. We present a unique case report and literature review focusing on DRESS syndrome-associated myocarditis resulting from reactivated viral infections in a 21-year-old female. 3 weeks after 5-day oral co-trimoxazole consumption due to acne, she developed symptoms consistent with DRESS syndrome, including a generalized maculopapular rash. Despite prednisolone treatment, the patient developed fatal fulminant myocarditis linked to HHV-6 and CMV reactivation. The patient's death highlights the importance of early recognition and careful management of DRESS syndrome, especially considering the potential viral reactivation that can lead to severe complications. Postmortem investigations revealed that viral reactivation caused myocarditis. Careful consideration must be given to corticosteroid usage in DRESS treatment, as inappropriate prescribing may promote viral reactivation and subsequent complications. While high-dose corticosteroids initiated within the first week effectively suppress HHV-6 reactivation. Conversely, low-dose or late-start high-dose corticosteroids prove ineffective in preventing HHV-6 viremia. Late- onset or low- dose corticosteroids may lead to fatal complications following the primary viral reactivation."
"V-domain Imuunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) seems a promising immune checkpoint target in cancer treatment; however, its prognostic significance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unknown. Herein, 29 fresh PDAC tissue samples were used to evaluate the mRNA expression level of VISTA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Besides, 40 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PDAC tissues were collected to evaluate VISTA protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR indicated that high expression of VISTA was significantly correlated with advanced stages of the cancer, based on the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stagingand tumor cell differentiation.  Immunohistochemistry results also showed significant correlation of the elevated cytoplasmic expression of VISTA with advanced TNM stages, older age of the patients and was a worsening indicator, regarding the disease-specific survival. In conclusion, we found that the expression levels of VISTA can be a potential prognostic biomarker in PDAC patients and its elevated levels are correlated with poor prognostic outcomes."
"Cervical cancer screening is a cornerstone of cervical cancer elimination. Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is recommended as the first step in screening provided that the assay used has been adequately validated. The Sansure® Human Papillomavirus DNA Diagnostic Kit is a new assay designed to detect HPV16, HPV18 and 13 other HPV in aggregate. The study aimed to evaluate the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of the assay according to international guidelines. Five hundred and fifty cervical residual cell samples from women attending cervical cancer screening were selected from the biobank of the HPV National Reference Centre in Belgium and used in this study. After DNA extraction, HPV was tested using the Sansure® Human Papillomavirus DNA Diagnostic Kit. The lower 95% confidence limit around the general reproducibility of this assay should be greater than or equal to 87%, with κ ≥ 0.50. Five hundred and thirty-three samples had valid results. The Sansure® Human Papillomavirus DNA Diagnostic Kit demonstrated an excellent intra-laboratory reproducibility of 93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.4-95.7, κ = 0.85). The interlaboratory reproducibility was 93.4 (95% CI: 91.0-95.4, κ = 0.84). Intra and interlaboratory reproducibility were also excellent at the genotype level. Excluding HPV53 single infection samples from the analyses also resulted in excellent agreement. These data show that the Sansure® Human Papillomavirus DNA Diagnostic Kit is highly reproducible. © 2024 The Author(s). Journal of Medical Virology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is characterized by deposition of amyloid fibrils within the extracellular space, causing disarray of the myocardial structure and capillary architecture. This study aims to characterize the prevalence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) in patients with CA and to assess the association between MVO and prognosis. The study population comprised 800 patients, of which 400 had light-chain CA (AL-CA) and 400 had transthyretin CA (ATTR-CA). MVO was present in 221 (27.6%) patients, and more common in ATTR-CA than AL-CA (124 [56.1%] vs. 97 [43.9%], p = 0.033). Patients with MVO had a more severe cardiac phenotype evidenced by higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (3516 ng/L [1944-6247] vs. 2508 ng/L [1203-5752], p < 0.001), worse global longitudinal strain (-10.5% [-12.6; -7.9] vs. -12.0% [-16.0; -8.9], p < 0.001), and higher extracellular volume (56% [51-61] vs. 50% [45-57], p < 0.001). Patients with AL-CA and MVO had a higher serum troponin (86 ng/L [47-148] vs. 59 ng/L [44-78], p < 0.001), and higher T2 (53 ms [50-56] vs. 50 ms [48-52], p < 0.001), but lower extracellular volume (55% [50-60] vs. 58% [53-61], p = 0.008) and lower indexed myocyte cell volume (48.6 g/m 2 2 Microvascular obstruction is common in CA and is related to markers of amyloid infiltration. MVO is associated with an increased risk of mortality in AL-CA, but not in ATTR-CA. This reflects the intrinsic differences in disease biology between these two forms of CA, with MVO likely related to multiple myocardial processes, amyloid infiltration, oedema and myocyte death. © 2024 The Author(s).

"This study aimed to analyze the demographic characteristics, symptoms, and treatment outcomes of patients diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) using computed tomography venography (CTV). Medical records of patients diagnosed with MTS through CTV at Hebei General Hospital of China between April 1, 2017, and May 31, 2022, were reviewed. The data collected included: (1) gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking and drinking habits; (2) time of onset and symptoms of MTS, as well as other accompanying symptoms; (3) additional diagnoses, length of hospital stay (days), treatment methods, treatment success, and the occurrence of post-treatment bleeding or recurrence. Descriptive statistics were used, with mean ± standard deviation and median values reported. The t-test/u-test and Chi-square test (including the exact probability method) were used to compare means and rates, respectively, with a significance level set at α = 0.05. Out of 402 patients (233 males, 169 females), 118 (29.4%) were diagnosed with MTS, with 47 (21.1%) males and 71 (39.7%) females. The incidence of MTS was significantly higher in females than males (χ 2 proportion 2 composition P 2 2 P 2 P CTV is highly effective in detecting and facilitating the successful treatment of MTS.

"Blastomycosis is an environmentally acquired fungal infection that can result in severe pulmonary illness and high hospitalization rates. In 2023, a blastomycosis outbreak was detected among workers at a paper mill in Delta County, Michigan. We included patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of blastomycosis who had spent ≥40 hours in Delta County since September 1, 2022 and had illness onset December 1, 2022-July 1, 2023. We assessed epidemiological and clinical features of patients and evaluated factors associated with hospitalization. We performed whole-genome sequencing to characterize genetic relatedness of clinical isolates from eight patients. In total, 131 patients were identified; all had worked at or visited the mill. Sixteen patients (12%) were hospitalized; one died. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, more hospitalized patients had diabetes (p=0.03) and urine antigen titers above the lower limit of quantification (p<0.001). Hospitalized patients were also more likely to have had ≥1 healthcare visits before receiving a blastomycosis diagnostic test (p=0.02) and to have been treated with antibiotics prior to antifungal prescription (p=0.001). All sequenced isolates were identified as Blastomyces gilchristii and clustered into a distinct outbreak cluster. This was the largest documented blastomycosis outbreak in the United States. Epidemiologic evidence indicated exposures occurred at or near the mill, and genomic findings suggested a common exposure source. Patients with diabetes may have increased risk for hospitalization, and elevated urine antigen titers could indicate greater disease severity. Early suspicion of blastomycosis may prompt earlier diagnosis and treatment, potentially reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and improving patient outcomes.

"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major health concerns due to their increasing incidence and high mortality. They are interconnected syndromes; AKI without recovery evolves into acute kidney disease (AKD), which can indicate an AKI-to-CKD transition. Both AKI and CKD are associated with a risk of long-term cardiovascular complications, but whether vascular and cardiac dysfunctions can occur as early as the AKD period has not been studied extensively. In a mouse model of kidney injury (KI) with non-recovery, we performed vasoreactivity and echocardiography analyses on days 15 (D15) and 45 (D45) after KI. We determined the concentrations of two major gut-derived protein-bound uremic toxins known to induce cardiovascular toxicity-indoxyl sulfate (IS) and para-cresyl sulfate (PCS)-and the levels of inflammation and contraction markers on D7, D15, and D45. Mice with KI showed acute tubular and interstitial kidney lesions on D7 and D15 and chronic glomerulosclerosis on D45. They showed significant impairment of aorta relaxation and systolic-diastolic heart function, both on D15 and D45. Such dysfunction was associated with downregulation of the expression of two contractile proteins, αSMA and SERCA2a, with a more pronounced effect on D15 than on D45. KI was also followed by a rapid increase in IS and PCS serum concentrations and the expression induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial adhesion molecules in serum and cardiovascular tissues. Therefore, these results highlight that AKD leads to early cardiac and vascular dysfunctions. How these dysfunctions could be managed to prevent cardiovascular events deserves further study."
"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have long been associated with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in children; but the data used is now over 6 years old (from 2017 to 2018). Understanding the current landscape of their prevalence and association is needed to capture evolving social, environmental, and economic conditions, and ensure interventions remain relevant to addressing current childhood trauma. This study provides an updated analysis of the association between ACEs and ADHD using post-acute-COVID-19 pandemic data. This cross-sectional study of 10,518 children aged 5 to 17 years old derived data from the 2021 to 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Differences in the prevalence of number (0, 1-3, or 4+) and type of ACEs by ADHD diagnosis were evaluated using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. All analyses incorporate complex survey weights. In 2021 to 2022, 2,457 (23.3%) of children experienced ACEs and 1,115 (9.9%) had an ADHD diagnosis. Children with ADHD were more likely to experience every type of ACE and were more likely to have 1 to 3 or 4+ ACEs than children without ADHD. Children with 4+ ACEs had higher odds of having an ADHD diagnosis (aOR: 3.44, 95% CI [2.64, 4.49]) than children without ACEs. Male children, children with fair or poor health, and children living in rural counties were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis, while children of color and uninsured children were less likely. We found the odds ratio of ADHD diagnosis for children with four or more ACEs, compared to those without ACEs, slightly lower than found in Brown et al., 2017's estimate of 3.97 (CI [3.29, 4.80]). These results suggest a consistent association between ACEs and ADHD when comparing pre-COVID data to our post-acute-COVID results. These findings highlight the need for clinicians to consider traumatic stress in ADHD screening. Policymakers and early childhood organizations should encourage early screening and intervention for ACEs to reduce the impacts of ADHD diagnoses."
"Reductions in all-cause otitis media (OM) following widespread pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use have plateaued. Granular burden of disease data are needed to guide evaluation and implementation of new measures targeting OM prevention. We conducted a retrospective study to assess the incidence and treatment costs of OM, tympanostomy tube placement (TTP), and hearing loss in children aged <5 years in the United States (US). OM episodes and TTP between 2016 and 2017 were identified in IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters, Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits, and Multi-Medicaid databases using diagnosis codes (ICD-10). The incidence rate per 100,000 person-years (IR) of OM in <5-year-olds was 62,726 in Commercial/Medicare databases and 55,874 in Medicaid. IRs peaked at 9-<12 months (115,552 and 110,960, respectively). Approximately 5% and 4% of OM episodes in the respective databases had TTP (IR 3233 and 2404). Around 2% of children with OM had hearing loss (IR 1468 and 1109, respectively), of whom 41% had TTP. We estimated that there were 11.1 million OM episodes in 2020 costing USD 4.8 billion. 243,618 children were estimated to have OM with hearing loss at a direct total cost of USD 637 million, or 13% of the overall cost. The clinical and economic burden attributable to OM in the US was high in children aged <5 years during the study period. Novel approaches are needed to improve and broaden vaccine-induced protection against OM and its complications. The study results could guide policymakers considering age-specific interventions to reduce the OM burden."
"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly aggressive neoplastic disease of the renal parenchyma that is characterized by an intrinsic resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy; for this reason, curative treatment is only achieved through surgical intervention in its early stages. The successful treatment of advanced or metastatic RCC will require the combined use of novel targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor blockers and immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Unfortunately, not all patients are candidates for such treatments, and at present, it is not possible to predict a patient's therapeutic response or likelihood to develop treatment‑associated complications. The present review described the literature focusing on the use of biomarkers for predicting patients' responses to therapies that induce immune checkpoint blockade in RCC."
"We demonstrate the peculiarities of diagnosis and successful multi-stage treatment of a patient with severe combined trauma and heart rupture complicated by extensive ischemic stroke in early postoperative period. A patient with severe combined injury was treated at the trauma center grade 3 (State Clinical Hospital No. 25, Volgograd) in 2023. We should remember Beck's triad and possible sternum fracture as a marker of severe chest injury for timely diagnosis of heart rupture with pericardial tamponade. Successful multi-stage treatment of a patient with severe combined trauma and cardiac rupture complicated by extensive ischemic stroke in early postoperative period was demonstrated."
"A rare case of thyroid foreign body is presented. The swallowed fish bone perforated the pharyngeal wall and migrated to the thyroid gland. The rarity of pathology caused diagnostic difficulties. Despite the correct diagnosis, wait-and-see tactics was initially chosen that delayed surgery and contributed to tissue inflammation. The stages of therapeutic and diagnostic process are analyzed. Endoscopy is not always effective, especially when foreign body migrates from pharyngeal lumen into soft tissues. Ultrasound and CT are necessary for topical diagnosis of migrated foreign body. These methods revealed fish bone migration towards cervical vascular bundle and local complications. Literature data and own experience are analyzed. Early surgical treatment guarantees good results and rapid rehabilitation."
"To create the prognostic scale based on some biomarkers after thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair. We analyzed 114 patients with aortic aneurysm/dissection. The following biomarkers were studied: proadrenomedullin, NT-proBNP, procalcitonin, interleukins 6, 8, 10, tumor necrosis factor, presepsin, highly sensitive troponin I. Stages of the study: before induction of anesthesia, at the end of surgery and 6 hours later. The most informative predictors of postoperative complications were identified using comparative and ROC analyses: baseline presepsin≥204 pg/ml and interleukin 6 ≥4.3 pg/ml. The scale based on assessment of presepsin and troponin I at the end of surgery and preoperative risk allows analysis of the risk of complicated postoperative period. If all three predictors are present, the risk of complicated postoperative period increases by 1.96 times. The equation based on serum presepsin, interleukin-8 and interleukin-6/interleukin-10 ratio in 6 hours after surgery is characterized by acceptable characteristics (AUC 0.785, 95% CI 0.700-0.870). An algorithm based on risk stratification consisting of 3 prognostic scales at various stages of perioperative period determines the probability of postoperative complications with sensitivity 67.2% and specificity 94.6%. The total share of correct predictions in this sample was 80.7±3.7%."
"In this study, we aimed to identify bone mineral density (BMD) trajectories of hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to determine the prognostic role of the trajectory groups. This is a retrospective study of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 treated in our hospital from November 2022 to February 2023. BMD was manually measured from the thoracic 12 (T12) and lumbar one (L1) vertebra using chest computed tomography images. We constructed group trajectory models using group-based trajectory modelling. We performed the logistic regression analysis to associate the BMD trajectory pattern with clinical outcomes. This study included 1767 patients. The mean follow-up time after discharge was 181.5 days (standard deviation (SD) = 9.7). There were 1137 (64.3%) male patients, and more than 80% of patients were aged >60 years. We successfully identified three latent BMD trajectories to reveal the dynamic effects of COVID-19 infection on bone health in patients, namely, the early low-normal decline group, the average, and the early high-rapid decline group. All groups demonstrated consistent overall declining trends. A significant association was observed between BMD trajectory pattern (T12 or L1) and baseline characteristics of sex, age, and penetrating keratoplasty (P < 0.05). Our study showed that the BMD trajectories were significantly associated with mortality. Furthermore, we found that these trajectories were also associated with the length of hospital stay. This study provided evidence for the COVID-19 process to bone health, as well as evidence on strengthening bone health management before and after COVID-19 infection. BMD trajectories may help manage bone health and guide treatment in patients with COVID-19. Copyright © 2024 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved."
"The early detection and accurate monitoring of suspicious skin lesions are critical for effective dermatological diagnosis and treatment, particularly for reliable identification of the progression of nevi to melanoma. The traditional diagnostic framework, the ABCDE rule, provides a foundation for evaluating lesion characteristics by visual examination using dermoscopes. Simulations of skin lesion progression could improve the understanding of melanoma growth patterns. This study aims to enhance lesion analysis and understanding of lesion progression by providing a simulated potential progression of nevi into melanomas. The study generates a dataset of simulated lesion progressions, from nevi to simulated melanoma, based on a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (Cycle-GAN) and frame interpolation. We apply an optical flow analysis to the generated dermoscopic image sequences, enabling the quantification of lesion transformation. In parallel, we evaluate changes in ABCDE rule metrics as example to assess the simulated evolution. We present the first simulation of nevi progressing into simulated melanoma counterparts, consisting of 152 detailed steps. The ABCDE rule metrics correlate with the simulation in a natural manner. For the seven samples studied, the asymmetry metric increased by an average of 19%, the border gradient metric increased by an average of 63%, the convexity metric decreased by an average of 3%, the diameter increased by an average of 2%, and the color dispersion metric increased by an average of 45%. The diagnostic value of the ABCDE rule is enhanced through the addition of insights based on optical flow. The outward expansion of lesions, as captured by optical flow vectors, correlates strongly with the expected increase in diameter, confirming the simulation's fidelity to known lesion growth patterns. The heatmap visualizations further illustrate the degree of change within lesions, offering an intuitive visual proxy for lesion evolution. The achieved simulations of potential lesion progressions could facilitate improved early detection and understanding of how lesions evolve. By combining the optical flow analysis with the established criteria of the ABCDE rule, this study presents a significant advancement in dermatoscopic diagnostics and patient education. Future research will focus on applying this integrated approach to real patient data, with the aim of enhancing the understanding of lesion progression and the personalization of dermatological care.

"This study aimed to analyze the prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings on MRI for endometriosis. Differences between patients with and without evidence of deep infiltrating endometriosis on MRI were to be examined. This was a retrospective, descriptive cross-sectional single-center study. All patients who received a pelvic MRI for endometriosis between April 2021 and February 2023 were included. The presence and frequency of incidental findings were noted after review of all MR images and radiology reports. The potential clinical significance of the findings was analyzed. Differences in the frequency of incidental findings between patients with and without evidence of deep infiltrating endometriosis on MRI were evaluated, utilizing the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney  U 303 consecutive patients (mean age, 33.4 years ± 8.3) were evaluated. Incidental findings were noted in 299/303 (98.7%) patients. Most frequently, ossification of the hip acetabular rim and degenerative changes of the lumbar spine were noted. In 25/303 (8.3%) patients, incidental findings had high clinical significance. For specific incidental findings, significantly higher prevalences were found in patients with than in patients without evidence of deep infiltrating endometriosis on MRI (hip acetabular rim ossification,  p p p Incidental findings are very common on pelvic MRI for endometriosis. The detection of incidental findings can lead to the diagnosis of relevant diseases and thus enable early treatment. On the other hand, many incidental findings have no, only minor, or uncertain consequences. Copyright © 2024 Harth, Roller, Brose, Kaya, Zeppernick, Meinhold-Heerlein and Krombach."
"The glaucoma treatment paradigm is starting to change from a more reactive approach that relies on topical medications to a more proactive approach that leverages procedural interventions. This evolution toward interventional glaucoma has been enabled by a growing array of lower-risk minimally invasive procedures such as laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, and procedural pharmaceuticals. A common feature of these glaucoma interventions-as with all glaucoma interventions-is the need for early, prompt, and accurate diagnosis. The present review summarizes new and upcoming developments in glaucoma diagnostics. These include technologies and techniques for home-based intraocular pressure measurement, novel visual field platforms, photography- and optical coherence tomography-based visualization, and artificial intelligence applications. They also include emerging technologies such as mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging, detection of apoptosing retinal cells, collector channel visualization, and genetic testing. These diagnostic modalities have the potential to circumvent the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. By increasing the frequency and feasibility of obtaining valuable glaucoma data with more rapid detection of disease and progression, these diagnostics may enable an interventional approach to glaucoma treatment for the betterment of patient care. © The Author(s), 2024."
"Hundreds of thousands of children are victims of non-accidental trauma each year. Its presentation can vary, and it may be difficult to recognize. However, due to its increased risk for fatality, it is imperative that physicians are aware and receptive to the signs of non-accidental trauma to assist with early detection. In a similar fashion, bleeding disorders vary in their presentations and their severity. They also have the potential to occur in the setting of non-accidental trauma, further complicating the diagnosis, increasing morbidity, and mortality. Due to this, suspicion and evaluation for non-accidental trauma should be followed by a bleeding disorder work-up. This case follows a child with undiagnosed Hemophilia-A in the setting of suspected non-accidental trauma. It not only highlights the variation of presentations seen with these ailments but demonstrates the importance of evaluating for comorbidities in highly fatal conditions. © 2024 The Authors.

"Despite a higher rate of breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), efforts to treat the disease through breast cancer screening are suboptimal, resulting in late diagnosis of breast cancer and poor outcomes. Several studies have been conducted in SSA countries about screening uptake, yet they addressed country or sub-country level data and did not consider both individual and beyond-individual factors related to screening. Hence, pooled prevalence as well as multilevel correlates of screening in the region is sparse, which have been addressed by this study using the most recent data among women with SSA. This study was conducted using the Demographic Health Survey data (2013-2022) from six countries, and a total weighted sample of 95,248 women was examined. STATA version 16 was used for the data analysis. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed and significant predictors were reported using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The overall weighted prevalence of clinical breast cancer screening was 14.23% (95% CI: 13.97-14.75), with Namibia and Tanzania having the highest (24.5%) and lowest (5.19%) screening rates, respectively. Higher breast cancer screening uptake was observed among women of advanced age (35-49) [aOR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.60, 1.98], had higher educational levels [aOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.03], cohabited [aOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.55], in the richest wealth quintile [aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.95, 2.64], urban residents [aOR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.33], multiparous [aOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.68], visited health facilities [aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.52, 1.76], and read newspapers [aOR = 1.78; 95%CI: 1.60, 2.15]. The prevalence of clinical breast cancer screening was low (14%). Strengthening awareness campaigns, improving healthcare infrastructure, health education, universal health coverage, and screening program access, with a focus on rural areas, women who lack formal education, and low socioeconomic status, are critical to increasing breast cancer screening rates and equity. Scale-up local and regional collaborations and the involvement of media agencies in the implementation of screening programs, advocacy, dissemination of information, and integration of screening programs with their routine care, such as perinatal care, can boost the screening. The existing health service delivery points also need to focus on integrating breast cancer screening services with routine care such as perinatal care.

"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous, chronic, inflammatory musculoskeletal disease that can lead to peripheral and axial damage and loss of function. A clear difference between PsA and other forms of inflammatory arthritis is the different forms of bone remodeling seen in PSA which incorporates not only increased bone resorption with bone erosions, osteolysis, and loss of bone mineral density but also increased bone formation with periostitis, syndesmophytes, enthesiophytes, and ankylosis. PsA, if diagnosed late, will lead to significant structural damage, the most severe form of which is known as arthritis mutilans, and loss of physical function. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring both peripheral and axial conditions associated with PsA. Radiography is currently the main modality used to monitor structural damage in PsA though commonly used scoring systems do not include bony proliferation as a criterion. Besides, radiography is limited in determining the presence and cause of periarticular soft tissue thickening, which may arise from tendinosis, tenosynovitis, synovial proliferation, bursitis, or enthesitis. Recently, much more attention has been paid to determining the imaging characteristics of PsA, which enables more precise identification of disease and severity assessment. Newer imaging technologies also enable variations in normal bone microstructure to be distinguished from disease-related abnormality. This review discusses the current state of innovative imaging modalities in PsA, specifically concentrating on their roles in PsA diagnosis and treatment, improving the early detection of PsA, and identifying patients with skin psoriasis at risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. © The Author(s), 2024."
"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has significantly advanced the study and diagnosis of eye diseases. However, current clinical OCTA systems and software tools lack comprehensive quantitative analysis capabilities, limiting their full clinical utility. This paper introduces the OCTA Retinal Vessel Analyzer (OCTA-ReVA), a versatile open-source platform featuring a user-friendly graphical interface designed for the automated extraction and quantitative analysis of OCTA features. OCTA-ReVA includes traditional established OCTA features based on binary vascular image processing, such as blood vessel density (BVD), foveal avascular zone area (FAZ-A), blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), and blood vessel caliber (BVC). Additionally, it introduces new features based on blood perfusion intensity processing, such as perfusion intensity density (PID), vessel area flux (VAF), and normalized blood flow index (NBFI), which provide deeper insights into retinal perfusion conditions. These additional capabilities are crucial for the early detection and monitoring of retinal diseases. OCTA-ReVA demystifies the intricate task of retinal vasculature quantification, offering a robust tool for researchers and clinicians to objectively evaluate eye diseases and enhance the precision of retinal health assessments. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group."

"Stroke poses a significant global health threat, with millions affected annually, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Current stroke risk assessment for the general population relies on markers such as demographics, blood tests, and comorbidities. A minimally invasive, clinically scalable, and cost-effective way to directly measure cerebral blood flow presents an opportunity. This opportunity has the potential to positively impact effective stroke risk assessment prevention and intervention. Physiological changes in the cerebrovascular system, particularly in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia during voluntary breath-holding can offer insights into stroke risk assessment. However, existing methods for measuring cerebral perfusion reserves, such as blood flow and blood volume changes, are limited by either invasiveness or impracticality. Herein we propose a non-invasive transcranial approach using speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) to non-invasively monitor regional changes in brain blood flow and volume during breath-holding. Our study, conducted on 50 individuals classified into two groups (low-risk and higher-risk for stroke), shows significant differences in blood dynamic changes during breath-holding between the two groups, providing physiological insights for stroke risk assessment using a non-invasive quantification paradigm. Given its cost-effectiveness, scalability, portability, and simplicity, this laser-centric tool has significant potential for early diagnosis and treatment of stroke in the general population. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group."
"Primary gastric small cell carcinoma (GSCC) is an extremely rare type of small cell carcinoma. Its aggressive nature with early widespread metastasis and late detection gives it a poor prognosis with overall survival of <12 months. GSCC is a type of neuroendocrine tumor, and because of its histopathological similarity to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), treatment regimen of GSCC includes the same chemotherapy agents as SCLC. We report a case of a 57-year-old man who presented with signs of partial gastrointestinal obstruction and was found to have a primary stage IV GSCC with metastasis to the liver. © 2024 The Author(s).
