      "Treatment for breast cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy and / or radiation, and is usually administered over a course of several weeks. (1) Despite being the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, the management of breast cancers has evolved dramatically over the past decades. The development of targeted therapy has improved the survival of patients with breast carcinoma; however, it has also increased the risk of drug-related adverse events (ADRs), which can limit the use of these drugs and cause unnecessary side effects. In this context, understanding the causes of ADRs is crucial for the development and clinical use, as well as for improving drug safety. We conducted\n",
      "Treatment for breast cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. An understanding of breast anatomy and the breast and its surrounding structures is essential for surgical planning. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the anatomy of and techniques used for the treatment of benign and malignant breast diseases. This review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Medline Complete, Embase Classic, ERIC, Science Direct, ProQuest, Springer, Wiley, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SCOPUS, I\n",
      "Treatment for breast cancer includes local and / or systemic therapy. The use of systemic therapies has been increasing over the past decades; however, most of the available drugs have significant side effects. Based on the high prevalence of side-effects, it is important to identify and prioritize the most relevant side effect of each drug. We aimed to develop an algorithm to prioritize side impact of drugs used for the treatment of breast cancers. Thus, the main objective of this study was to construct a side Impact score (SIS) for each breast drug and its associated comorbidities. METHODS: We performed a literature review for side consequences of approved drugs for treatment breast-\n",

The breast is a complex structure and may be affected by radiation and chemotherapy in combination or sequentially. As a result, the radiation treatment has to be adapted to the individual patient. This paper provides a detailed overview of the treatment planning and delivery of breast radiation, including the physical principles, dose calculation, clinical applications, treatment verification, patient positioning, image guidance, quality assurance, planning, radiotherapy delivery, normal tissue toxicity, toxicity management, as well as follow-up. In addition, this paper also provides practical advice on how to ensure that all these aspects are\n",

However, the recent introduction of targeted therapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for HER2-positive patients, has changed the treatment paradigm. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical trials and the most recent data on the role and safety of systemic therapies, with a focus on TKIs. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed and Embase.

Patients were administered questionnaires to collect socio-demographic data and lung symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. Caregivers were also administered the same questionnaire.

This study aimed to examine the association between self-reported symptoms and the diagnosis and treatment of early-onset breast lumps.

Lung adenocarcinoma is an invasive type of non-small cell lung carcinoma, with a more aggressive and invasive growth pattern. In this study, we aimed to identify the potential targets of natural compounds in lung adenocarcinoma and explore the effects of the combination of two natural agents (curcumin and baicalin) on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human lung A549 cell lines. We used a combination index (CI) method to analyze the growth inhibition of A549 cells in the presence of different concentrations of curcumin, baicalein, or the two compounds\n"

Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, the disease remains a major cause of mortality in women. New diagnostic and therapeutic methods are needed to improve the treatment outcomes for this cancer. In this review, we summarize the current advances and future prospects of non-invasive, real-time detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We also discuss the clinical implications of CTCs in cancer treatment, including the use of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for monitoring treatment response,\n",

Vitamin D status was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, or the number of lymph nodes. However, the vitamin A level was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (P\n",
      "Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, and the incidence is increasing. A major cause for this increase is the poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression. The development of targeted therapies for breast cancers has resulted in increased patient survival; however, these therapies have failed to significantly improve the survival of patients with triple-negative breast carcinomas. Recent research has identified a number of important driver genes involved in breast carcinogenesis, which may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting the response to targeted therapy. However, the clinical significance of these biomarkers is unclear. To investigate the prognostic value of several driver gene mutations in patients\n",

Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic variables, risk perceptions, and breast screening.

      "Breast cancer is a complex disease that is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous tumor subtypes. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a role in breast cancer progression. DNA hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing, and epigenetic alterations are implicated in several human cancers, in particular in the regulation of the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in tumor progression and metastasis. Aberrant histone methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates the gene expression, leading to an increase in gene transcription. Histone modifications are reversible, with histone methyltransferases (HMT) and demethylases (HDMs) being key regulators of these processes.\n"

      "Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. A pancreatic cancer stem cell (CSC) model has been developed, in which the pancreatic CSC subpopulation is enriched by enriching cells in a serum-free, chemically defined medium containing epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factors, and insulin-like growth Factor-2. The pancreatic CSCs are characterized by a high level of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and cancer cell self-renewal. Here, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol compound, on the proliferation and viability of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as well as on pancreatic and CSC characteristics.\n",
      "Pancreatic cancer is a highly invasive and fatal cancer. A review of clinical studies using the most frequently used therapeutic approaches: chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to discuss the current evidence regarding the treatment of pancreatic cancer, focusing on chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Currently, in the majority of cases, treatment is based on the use of a combination of chemotherapy with targeted agents or immunotherapy; however, there is no evidence supporting the routine use or the best regimen for the management of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. New therapeutic strategies are being developed for patients who have already progressed on these treatments. This is particularly important given the poor prognosis\n",

Here, we demonstrate that the microRNA-155 (miR-155m) expression level was significantly elevated in PC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR ‑ 153m in pancreatic cancer cells promoted cell growth, migration and invasion, whereas its inhibition inhibited the cell proliferation, invasion and migration of PC cells. Furthermore, the mechanistic studies revealed that miR -153b directly targeted the 3 'untranslated region of MLL3, a well ‑ known tumor suppressor gene. In\n"
