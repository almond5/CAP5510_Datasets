Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada and a significant 
cause of morbidity for patients and their loved ones. There have been rapid 
advances in preventing, screening and treating this disease. Here, we present a 
contemporary review of treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in Canada based 
on current best practices. The focus of this review is to highlight recent data 
in screening for lung cancer, management of patients with early and 
locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer, as well as management of patients 
with metastatic disease. There is a special focus on the incorporation of 
immunotherapy into practice and its associated toxicities.

For patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), the last 
decade has been characterized by critical progress that has contributed to 
substantially improved survival. In particular, the development of specific 
antibodies against the programmed death (PD-1) receptor, programmed death-ligand 
1 (PD-L1), and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 receptor in the 
therapeutic strategy of mNSCLC either in first- or in second-line settings have 
led to unprecedented prolonged survival for a proportion of these patients. 
Although clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors with anti-PD-1 and 
PD-L1 therapies largely began as monotherapy in the second-line setting, the 
more recent progress has shifted toward combination approaches in first-line 
settings as well as the integration of immunotherapy into the clinical paradigm 
in earlier stages. Today, with the exception of mNSCLC harboring targetable 
oncogenes, nearly all patients with mNSCLC receive PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy in 
first-line settings. Here we report the current status of first-line 
immunotherapy in mNSCLC together with current challenges in selecting the best 
immunotherapeutic approach for the individual patient.

Unlike non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression of small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) is slow. Extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) is a serious threat to 
human health, with a 5-year survival rate of <7%. Chemotherapy has been the 
first-line treatment for the past 30 years. The anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockades 
durvalumab and atezolizumab have greatly prolonged overall survival and have 
become the standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC since the CASPIAN and 
IMpower133 trials. In the era of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), including 
thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and brain radiation therapy (BRT), has shown 
clinical effects in randomized and retrospective studies on ES-SCLC. 
RT-immunotherapy has shown exciting synergistic effects in NSCLC. For ES-SCLC, 
the clinical effects of combining TRT/BRT with immunotherapy have not yet been 
systematically explored. In this review, we found that studies on 
RT-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC are relatively few and limited to early phase 
studies focusing on toxicity. The efficacy and safety profiles of early phase 
studies encourage prospective clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the 
best population, optimum TRT dose, proper TRT time, and strategies for reducing 
radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we suggest that biomarkers and 
patient performance status should be fully assessed before RT-immunotherapy 
treatment. Prospective trials are needed to provide more evidence for 
RT-immunotherapy applications in ES-SCLC."

Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.


Precision oncology comprises the set of strategies that aim to design the best 
cancer treatment based on tumor biology. A recognized subset of patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbor actionable genomic aberrations that 
can benefit from targeted therapy. In lung cancer, epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements 
are well characterized oncogenic drivers for which the therapeutic use of 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors has demonstrated improved outcomes compared with 
chemotherapy. Other druggable targets are also well characterized, and effective 
inhibitors have been developed and commercialized, leading to a paradigm shift 
in NSCLC treatment. Here, the authors provide a review of the oncogenic role of 
the most relevant molecular alterations in NSCLC and emerging treatments in this 
setting beyond EGFR-driven and ALK-driven diseases."

Patient-Centered Palliative Care for Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer.

Temel JS




General Hospital, Boston, MA.

Hospital, Boston, MA.


The evidence base demonstrating the benefits of an early focus on palliative 
care for patients with serious cancers, including advanced lung cancer, is 
substantial. Early involvement of specialty-trained palliative care clinicians 
in the care of patients with advanced lung cancer improves patient-reported 
outcomes, such as quality of life, and health care delivery, including hospice 
utilization. Since the time that many of these palliative care trials were 
conducted, the paradigm of cancer care for many cancers, including lung cancer, 
has changed dramatically. The majority of patients with advanced lung cancer are 
now treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, both of 
which have had a significant impact on patient's experience and outcomes. With 
this changing landscape of lung cancer therapeutics, patients are facing new and 
different challenges, including dealing with novel side effect profiles and 
coping with greater uncertainty regarding their prognosis. Patients who are 
living longer with their advanced cancer also struggle with how to address 
survivorship issues, such as sexual health and exercise, and decision making 
about end-of-life care. Although palliative care clinicians remain well-suited 
to address these care needs, they may need to learn new skills to support 
patients treated with novel therapies. Additionally, as the experience of 
patients with advanced lung cancer is becoming more varied and individualized, 
palliative care research interventions and clinical programs should also be 
delivered in a patient-centered manner to best meet patient's needs and improve 
their outcomes. Tailored and technology-based palliative care interventions are 
promising strategies for delivering patient-centered palliative care.

Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause 
of cancer death worldwide. The most common histological type is non-small-cell 
lung cancer, accounting for 85% of all lung cancer cases. About one out of three 
new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer are diagnosed at a locally advanced 
stage-mainly stage III-consisting of a widely heterogeneous group of patients 
presenting significant differences in terms of tumor volume, local diffusion, 
and lymph nodal involvement. Stage III NSCLC therapy is based on the pivotal 
role of multimodal treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy, and a 
wide-ranging option of systemic treatments. Radical surgery is indicated in the 
case of hilar lymphnodal involvement or single station mediastinal ipsilateral 
involvement, possibly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; the best appropriate 
treatment for multistation mediastinal lymph node involvement still represents a 
matter of debate. Although the main scope of treatments in this setting is 
potentially curative, the overall survival rates are still poor, ranging from 
36% to 26% and 13% in stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively. The aim of this 
article is to provide an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of the 
state-of-the-art treatments for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer."

Systemic and Radiation Therapy Approaches for Locally Advanced Non-Small-Cell 
Lung Cancer.

Higgins KA



University, Atlanta, GA.

Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.


The treatment for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has changed 
dramatically over the past several years, with consolidative immunotherapy after 
concurrent chemoradiation becoming the new standard of care. Five-year survival 
outcomes have substantially improved with this approach. Despite these advances, 
further improvements are needed as the majority of patients ultimately develop 
progression of disease. The next-generation immunotherapy trials are currently 
being conducted that include approaches such as concurrent immunotherapy and 
addition of other therapeutic agents in the concurrent and consolidative 
settings. Specific unmet needs continue to exist for patients who develop 
disease progression after concurrent chemoradiation and immunotherapy, as well 
as defining the best treatment for patients with driver mutations. Future 
directions also include refinement of radiation techniques to reduce toxicities 
as much as possible, as well as the use of circulating tumor DNA in the 
surveillance setting. The current scientific landscape shows promising 
approaches that may further improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced 
non-small-cell lung cancer.

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death globally. Delayed 
diagnosis is a major contributing factor to poor outcomes and remains a key 
challenge to overcome. While debate around the implementation of lung cancer 
screening for asymptomatic high-risk individuals continues, rapid access to 
relevant diagnostic tests is essential. The new National Optimal Lung Cancer 
Pathway describes 'diagnostic standards of care' in an effort to implement best 
practice, reduce variation and improve delays in diagnosis, staging and 
treatment of lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment continues to develop with new 
surgical techniques, radiotherapy options and more drugs being licensed as part 
of standard treatment. We provide an overview of the core lung cancer diagnostic 
steps, recognition and management of acute presentations as well as the latest 
treatment options."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, as 
first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A systematic

This network meta-analysis (NMA), based on 12 phase-III studies with 9,236 
metastatic NSCLC patients, aims to compare the efficacy of treatments including 
at least one immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) with or without chemotherapy, as 
frontline therapy for advanced NSCLC patients. The NMA includes direct 
randomized evidence on treatments of interest along with indirect evidence from 
randomized studies with chemotherapy as the common comparator. Studies were 
identified by searching PubMed, and the abstracts of most recent main oncology 
congresses. The primary endpoint, Hazard-Ratio (HR) of Progression-free Survival 
(PFS), was estimated by a frequentist-approach NMA. Results are presented in the 
overall cohort (all-comers or PD-L1-positive) irrespective of histology, and by 
histology, PD-L1 expression level and sex. According to the primary PFS-NMA in 
the overall cohort, the combination of chemotherapy, first with pembrolizumab, 
second with atezolizumab exhibit significantly higher benefit than any other 
treatment examined. This superior PFS benefit is found for both squamous and 
non-squamous patients. Similarly for OS, the combination of 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, and atezolizumab/bevacizumab/chemotherapy-(ABC), 
followed by pembrolizumab-monotherapy and atezolizumab/chemotherapy, are the 
best treatments in the overall cohort, driven by the non-squamous histology. In 
the PD-L1-high patients again the combination of chemotherapy with atezolizumab 
or pembrolizumab, exhibit significant PFS benefit, followed by 
pembrolizumab-monotherapy. PFS benefit of these ICI/chemotherapy combinations 
are also found in PD-L1-negative and PD-L1-intermediate 
patients(1%≤PD-L1 < 50%). Of note, ABC is evaluated only for OS in non-squamous 
patients while the pembrolizumab-monotherapy PFS benefit and the 
atezolizumab/chemotherapy OS benefit are probably under-estimated since most of 
the data stems from non-significant interim analyses of ongoing studies 
[KN042;IM131/132/150]. In conclusion, the addition of chemotherapy to ICIs 
enhanced their treatment efficacy as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC 
patients. The combination of chemotherapy with either pembrolizumab or 
atezolizumab show consistently higher efficacy than chemotherapy-alone or any 
other ICI-combination or monotherapy, particularly in non-squamous patients."

starting early and given concurrently with chemotherapy. At ASCO, 2016, 
Faivre-Finn and colleagues presented the results of the CONVERT trial, comparing 
such a scheme with once daily radiotherapy to a higher dose. There was no 
statistically significant difference in survival between the two arms. Although 
the publication of the study is still awaited, this editorial puts the available

Targeting the Mevalonate Pathway for Treating Lung Cancer.

Fatehi Hassanabad A




The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is a key metabolic pathway involved in various 
important cellular functions. Its downstream products are critical for 
cell-signaling, cell membrane integrity, protein synthesis, and cellular 
respiration. The rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway is targeted by statins, a 
class of medications best known for their lipid-lowering effects. Many studies 
have shown that a variety of cancerous cells have a dysregulated MVA pathway. 
Lung cancer is responsible for a third of all cancer-related deaths worldwide. 
As our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of 
lung cancer improves, newer therapeutics have been proposed. However, these 
medications have not had the expected benefits for all subtypes of lung cancer. 
Therefore, there exists a significant role in identifying medications with safe 
profiles, which can potentially be used in managing various types of lung 
cancer. Herein, we review whether there is a role in utilizing statins to target 
the MVA pathway in treating lung cancer."

Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) represents most lung cancer cases, and approximately one-third of 
patients present with stage III disease at diagnosis. As multiple treatment 
plans can be adopted for these patients depending on tumor size and nodal 
staging, stage III NSCLC management is challenging. Over the past decades, 
multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) have been implemented in healthcare services to 
coordinate actions among the different health care professionals involved in 
cancer care. The aim of this review was to discuss real-world evidence of the 
impact of MDTs on stage III NSCLC management, survival, and quality of life. 
Here, we performed a literature review to investigate the role of nutrition and 
navigational nursing in NSCLC care and the influence of MDTs in the choice of 
treatment plans, including immunotherapy consolidation, and in the management of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy-related adverse events. We also performed a 
mapping review to identify gaps in the implementation of cancer care MDTs in 
healthcare services around the world.

We are witnessing a silent revolution in the treatment of early stage non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a series of practice-changing clinical trials 
enriching the therapeutic perspectives of lung cancer patients with potentially 
curable disease. The ADAURA study marked the advent of precision medicine and 
biomarker testing to the early stages setting. The IMPower-010 trial interrupted 
the negative trend of adjuvant lung cancer immunotherapy, paving the way to the 
application of immune-checkpoint inhibition in the resected disease. The ITACA 
trial definitively established no role for tailored adjuvant chemotherapy in 
NSCLC, while the Lung Art data questioned the efficacy of post-operative 
radiotherapy for pN2 resected disease. Growing evidence is supporting MRD as 
effective adjuvant prognostic biomarker to stratify disease's recurrence risk 
after radical interventions and select best candidates to the adjuvant 
strategies. This work summarizes the recent major breakthroughs in lung cancer 
adjuvant treatment, and provides a snapshot of the current real-world scenario, 
discussing the upcoming challenges and opportunities featuring the clinical 
management of early stage NSCLC patients."

BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is resistant 
to PD-1 and PD-L1 (PD[L]-1)-targeted therapy have poor outcomes. Studies suggest 
that radiotherapy could enhance antitumour immunity. Therefore, we investigated 
the potential benefit of PD-L1 (durvalumab) and CTLA-4 (tremelimumab) inhibition 
alone or combined with radiotherapy.
METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 2 trial was done by the 
National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network at 
18 US sites. Patients aged 18 years or older with metastatic NSCLC, an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and progression during 
previous PD(L)-1 therapy were eligible. They were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in a 
web-based system by the study statistician using a permuted block scheme (block 
sizes of three or six) without stratification to receive either durvalumab (1500 
mg intravenously every 4 weeks for a maximum of 13 cycles) plus tremelimumab (75 
mg intravenously every 4 weeks for a maximum of four cycles) alone or with 
low-dose (0·5 Gy delivered twice per day, repeated for 2 days during each of the 
first four cycles of therapy) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (24 Gy total 
delivered over three 8-Gy fractions during the first cycle only), 1 week after 
initial durvalumab-tremelimumab administration. Study treatment was continued 
until 1 year or until progression. The primary endpoint was overall response 
rate (best locally assessed confirmed response of a partial or complete 
response) and, along with safety, was analysed in patients who received at least 
one dose of study therapy. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT02888743, and is now complete.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 24, 2017, and March 29, 2019, 90 patients were enrolled 
and randomly assigned, of whom 78 (26 per group) were treated. This trial was 
stopped due to futility assessed in an interim analysis. At a median follow-up 
of 12·4 months (IQR 7·8-15·1), there were no differences in overall response 
rates between the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group (three [11·5%, 90% CI 
1·2-21·8] of 26 patients) and the low-dose radiotherapy group (two [7·7%, 
0·0-16·3] of 26 patients; p=0·64) or the hypofractionated radiotherapy group 
(three [11·5%, 1·2-21·8] of 26 patients; p=0·99). The most common grade 3-4 
adverse events were dyspnoea (two [8%] in the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone 
group; three [12%] in the low-dose radiotherapy group; and three [12%] in the 
hypofractionated radiotherapy group) and hyponatraemia (one [4%] in the 
durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group vs two [8%] in the low-dose radiotherapy 
group vs three [12%] in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group). 
Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in one (4%) patient in the 
durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group (maculopapular rash), five (19%) patients in 
the low-dose radiotherapy group (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, 
hypokalemia, and respiratory failure), and four (15%) patients in the 
hypofractionated group (adrenal insufficiency, colitis, diarrhoea, and 
hyponatremia). In the low-dose radiotherapy group, there was one death from 
respiratory failure potentially related to study therapy.
INTERPRETATION: Radiotherapy did not increase responses to combined PD-L1 plus 
CTLA-4 inhibition in patients with NSCLC resistant to PD(L)-1 therapy. However, 
PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 therapy could be a treatment option for some patients. Future 
studies should refine predictive biomarkers in this setting.

Drug Combinatorial Therapies for the Treatment of KRAS Mutated Lung Cancers.

He H





KRAS is the most common oncogene to be mutated in lung cancer, and therapeutics 
directly targeting KRAS have proven to be challenging. The mutations of KRAS are 
associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to both adjuvant therapy and 
targeted EGFR TKI. EGFR TKIs provide significant clinical benefit for patients 
whose tumors bear EGFR mutations. However, tumors with KRAS mutations rarely 
respond to the EGFR TKI therapy. Thus, combination therapy is essential for the 
treatment of lung cancers with KRAS mutations. EGFR TKI combined with inhibitors 
of MAPKs, PI3K/mTOR, HDAC, Wee1, PARP, CDK and Hsp90, even miRNAs and 
immunotherapy, were reviewed. Although the effects of the combination vary, the 
combined therapeutics are one of the best options at present to treat KRAS 
mutant lung cancer.

Exploring Liposomes for Lung Cancer Therapy.

Shahid A




Cancer is referred to as a pleiotropic disease-causing approximately 9.6 million 
deaths in 2018. Among all cancers, lung cancer was the leading cause of death in 
2017, and 12% of fatalities were alone due to lung cancer. The associated risk 
factors in lung cancer include smoking (80-85%), chronic inflammation in the 
lungs, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, environmental and occupational exposure to 
nickel, arsenic, chromates, etc. Early diagnosed patients' treatment plan 
includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and tumor ablation. 
Many sorts of drug delivery carriers have been used in the past, usually in 
targeted chemotherapy. Liposomes are spherical shape vesicles containing a lipid 
bilayer and aqueous core, with potency to encapsulate both hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic drugs with minimal toxicity. These vesicles have a particle size of 
0.02-1000 μm allowing selective passive targeting to the tumor's deeper tissues. 
Current publications on liposomes highlight their acceptance and best choice 
among all systems to deliver synthetic and herbal drugs to the lungs. This 
review focuses on many aspects, which include an in-depth analysis of potential 
anticancer drugs that have utilized the advantages of liposomes for effective 
lung carcinomatherapy and devices used to deliver the active agents to the 
pulmonary tissues. Investigations on ongoing, approved, and failed clinical 
trials and patents on products related to lung cancer have been highlighted to 
provide a critical review on the subject."

Is radiofrequency ablation or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy the best 
treatment for radically treatable primary lung cancer unfit for surgery?

Renaud S



Hospital, Strasbourg Cedex, France.

Comment in
    Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2013 Jan;16
10.1093/icvts/ivs486.

A best evidence topic was constructed according to a structured protocol. The 
question addressed was whether radiofrequency (RF) offers better results than 
stereotactic ablative therapy in patients suffering from primary non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) unfit for surgery. Of the 90 papers found using a report 
search for RF, 5 represented the best evidence to answer this clinical question. 
Concerning stereotactic ablative therapy, of the 112 papers found, 10 
represented the best evidence to answer this clinical question. A manual search 
of the reference lists permitted us to include seven more articles. The authors, 
journal, date, country of publication, study type, group studied, relevant 
outcomes and results of these papers are given. We conclude that, on the whole, 
the 23 retrieved studies clearly support the use of stereotactic ablative 
therapy rather than RF in patients suffering from primary NSCLC unfit for 
surgery. Indeed, stereotactic ablative therapy offered a 5-year local control 
rate varying between 83 and 89.5%, whereas the local control rate after RF 
ranges from 58 to 68%, with a short follow-up of ∼18 months. Furthermore, both 
overall survival and cancer-specific survival were better with stereotactic 
ablative therapy, with a 3-year overall survival ranging from 38 to 84.7% and 
the 3-year cancer-specific survival from 64 to 88%, whereas the 3-year OS, only 
reported in two studies, ranged from 47 to 74% for RF. Moreover, the 
post-interventional morbidity was superior for RF ranging from 33 to 100% 
(mainly composed by pneumothorax), whereas radiation pneumonitis and rib 
fracture, ranging, respectively, from 3 to 38% and 1.6 to 4%, were the primary 
complications following stereotactic ablative therapy. Hence, the current 
evidence shows that stereotactic ablative therapy is a safe and effective 
procedure and should be proposed first to patients suffering from primary NSCLC 
unfit for surgery. However, the published evidence is quite limited, mainly 
based on small studies of <100 patients. Moreover, so far there is no blind, 
prospective control, randomized study comparing these two techniques. 
Consequently, despite the encouragement of these preliminary results, they must 
be interpreted with caution."

Review of economic analyses of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Vergnenègre A



France.

Créteil , Créteil , France.

INTRODUCTION: During the past few years, medical-economic evaluation of lung 
cancers (LCs) has become unavoidable. Total management costs have been rising 
constantly, with values almost doubling every 10 years. The financial impact 
will be even greater with the new molecules now marketed. The methodology for 
these studies conforms with international recommendations but must be adapted to 
the new stakes of LC management.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the available literature 
concerning the economics of treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
first address the global costs of LCs. Detailed analyses were then computed for 
the different LC stages: localized, locally advanced and metastatic. For 
metastatic NSCLC, subsections are devoted to targeted therapies and 
immunotherapies.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Drug costs are one of the major challenges of LC management. 
The multiplication of medical-economic analyses will assure better access to the 
marketing of these new and expensive therapeutic agents, but also to the 
selection of the best management strategy for these cancers."

July University (UNINOVE), São Paulo, Brazil./Nine of July Hospital, São Paulo, 
Brazil.

BACKGROUND: The advances in the lung cancer screening methods and therapeutics, 
together with awareness towards deleterious habits, such as smoking, is 
increasing the overall survival with better quality of life for the patients. 
However, lung cancer is still one of the most common and fatal neoplasm with a 
high incidence and consequently burden to public health worldwide. Thus, based 
on guidelines and recent phases II and III clinical trials studies, this 
manuscript summarizes the current treatment sequencing strategies in lung 
cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of related articles was performed focused on 
phases II and III clinical trials studies.
RESULTS: The lung cancer management should take into consideration the tumor 
characteristics, histology, molecular pathology and be discussed in a 
multidisciplinary team. Lung cancer treatment options comprises surgery whenever 
possible, radiotherapy associate with/or chemotherapy and immunotherapy as 
monotherapy, or combined with chemotherapy and best palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: The screening predictability in more patients, smoking reduction, 
early diagnosis, better disease understanding and individualized, more effective 
and tolerable therapeutics are related to an increasing in overall survival and 
quality of life. In the near future improvement of personalized therapy in 
precision medicine is expected, enhancing new predictive biomarkers, optimal 
doses and optimal treatment sequencing as well as anti-cancer vaccines 
development."

Chemotherapy for lung cancer: the state of the art in 2009.

mhiggin9@jhmi.edu

Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related death among men and 
women worldwide. Incremental and significant advances in available systemic 
treatments, however, have taken place in the last decade to provide improved 
survival rates and better palliation for patients with non-small-cell and 
small-cell lung cancer. Superior imaging techniques have enabled the detection 
of early-stage disease and adjuvant chemotherapy has earned a place for select 
patients following resection of their tumors. Perhaps the largest growth has 
been in the area of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, in which multiple new 
combination and single-agent systemic therapies have become standard where 
previously only 'best supportive care' was thought appropriate. In concert with 
broader applicability of chemotherapy, translational studies have provided the 
rationale for using molecular markers to identify the patients most likely to 
benefit from biological and targeted therapies. This review will discuss the 
current role of chemotherapy in both early and advanced non-small-cell and 
small-cell lung cancer. Novel targeted systemic therapies and the appropriate 
selection of treatments for patients based on their tumors' molecular phenotypes 
and histologies will also be reviewed."

Immunotherapy is a new genre of treatment for patients with advanced cancer. 
Initially approved for use in metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy has found a 
significant place in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical 
trials using several combinations of immunotherapy are underway to help to 
determine the best treatment for specific patient groups. This article reviews 
approved uses of immunotherapy for NSCLC, immune-related toxicities, and 
explores the future direction of this treatment."

The prognosis of lung cancer patients has improved in the last few years. 
Despite definitive therapy, local recurrence or a second primary tumour can 
occur in many patients within previously irradiated areas. Recent developement 
of more accurate techniques in radiation oncology allows delivery of high 
radiation dose to the tumor with the aim of improving local control, delaying 
disease progression and in some cases even curing. Nevertheless, the use of high 
dose in the reirradiation setting is not without risks, especially when 
treatment volumes overlap with previously irradiated tissues. The risk of 
adverse effects must be balanced with the choice of an effective treatment by 
selecting suitable candidates and the best radiation technique. In this systemic 
review efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation in locoregionally recurrent 
non-small-cell lung cancer is extensively discussed. Results indicate that 
reirradiation might be beneficial in well-selected patients. Prospective and 
high quality studies are necessary in this field.

BACKGROUND: Current treatment guidelines for limited-stage small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) recommend concomitant platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy plus 
prophylactic cranial irradiation, based on the premise that SCLC disseminates 
early, and is chemosensitive. However, although there is usually a favourable 
initial response, relapse is common and the cure rate for limited-stage SCLC 
remains relatively poor. Some recent clinical practice guidelines have 
recommended surgery for stage 1 (limited) SCLC followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy, but this recommendation is largely based on the findings of 
observational studies.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether, in patients with limited-stage SCLC, surgical 
resection of cancer improves overall survival and treatment-related deaths 
compared with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy, or best supportive care.
SEARCH METHODS: We performed searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and 
Web of Science up to 11 January 2017. We handsearched review articles, clinical 
trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with adults 
diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC, confirmed by cytology or histology, and 
radiological assessment, considered medically suitable for resection and radical 
radiotherapy, which randomised participants to surgery versus any other 
intervention.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We imported studies identified by the search into 
a reference manager database. We retrieved the full-text version of relevant 
studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. The primary 
outcome measures were overall survival and treatment-related deaths; and 
secondary outcome measures included loco-regional progression, quality of life, 
and adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials with 330 participants. We judged the 
quality of the evidence as very low for all the outcomes. The quality of the 
data was limited by the lack of complete outcome reporting, unclear risk of bias 
in the methods in which the studies were conducted, and the age of the studies 
(> 20 years). The methods of cancer staging and types of surgical procedures, 
which do not reflect current practice, reduced our confidence in the estimation 
of the effect.Two studies compared surgery to radiation therapy, and in one 
study chemotherapy was administered to both arms. One study administered initial 
chemotherapy, then responders were randomised to surgery versus control; 
following, both groups underwent chest and whole brain irradiation.Due to the 
clinical heterogeneity of the trials, we were unable to pool results for 
meta-analysis.All three studies reported overall survival. One study reported a 
mean overall survival of 199 days in the surgical arm, compared to 300 days in 
the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.04). One study reported overall survival as 4% in 
the surgical arm, compared to 10% in the radiotherapy arm at two years. 
Conversely, one study reported overall survival at two years as 52% in the 
surgical arm, compared to 18% in the radiotherapy arm. However this difference 
was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).One study reported early 
postoperative mortality as 7% for the surgical arm, compared to 0% mortality in 
the radiotherapy arm. One study reported the difference in mean degree of 
dyspnoea as -1.2 comparing surgical intervention to radiotherapy, indicating 
that participants undergoing radiotherapy are likely to experience more 
dyspnoea. This was measured using a non-validated scale.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from currently available RCTs does not support a 
role for surgical resection in the management of limited-stage small-cell lung 
cancer; however our conclusions are limited by the quality of the available 
evidence and the lack of contemporary data. The results of the trials included 
in this review may not be generalisable to patients with clinical stage 1 
small-cell lung cancer carefully staged using contemporary staging methods. 
Although some guidelines currently recommend surgical resection in clinical 
stage 1 small-cell lung cancer, prospective randomised controlled trials are 
needed to determine if there is any benefit in terms of short- and long-term 
mortality and quality of life compared with chemo-radiotherapy alone.

What is the role for surgery in patients with stage III non-small cell lung 
cancer?

Vandenbroucke E



Belgium.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
represents a therapeutic challenge. Although combined modality has become the 
standard treatment in stage III NSCLC, the role of surgery in it remains 
controversial. This review will address recent evidence on the potential role of 
surgery in either superior sulcus tumors, T4N0-1 tumors with central extension 
multifocal tumors with nodule(s) in the same lobe, or stage III disease with 
mediastinal lymph node involvement.
RECENT FINDINGS: Two recent phase 2 trials, exploring surgical resection 
preceded by induction chemoradiotherapy for tumors of the superior sulcus, have 
reported an impressive survival with acceptable mortality rate. They confirm the 
outcome observed in other prospective and retrospective series for T3-4N0-1. For 
subsets of T4 NSCLC with central extension or with satellite nodule(s) in the 
primary lobe, cumulative data suggest that these tumors behave differently than 
other stage IIIB tumors and might benefit from upfront surgery, possibly 
followed by postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Whenever clinical 
mediastinal lymph node invasion is present, surgery after induction treatment is 
not proven superior to radiotherapy, and is best restricted to clinical trials.
SUMMARY: Combined modality treatment is the standard of care for locally 
advanced NSCLC and the optimal role for surgery remains a challenging issue for 
the clinicians."

Molecular targeted therapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: will it 
increase the cure rate?

Martinez P



Spain.

Spain. Electronic address: efelip@vhebron.net.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of all lung 
cancer cases, with a world-wide annual incidence of around 1.3 million. Surgery 
remains the corner stone of treatment in early-stage NSCLC when feasible, and 
the addition of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has improved these results 
in resected NSCLC patients. For those patients with non-metastatic NSCLC not 
suitable for complete surgical resection, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy remains 
the best treatment option. For patients with metastatic NSCLC, molecular 
targeted agents have become part of the therapeutic arsenal in recent years. 
However, to date no targeted agent has been approved for patients with early or 
locally-advanced stages of NSCLC. Here, we review the rationale, literature and 
studies addressing the role of targeted agents used in the adjuvant setting or 
as part of chemoradiotherapy regimens."

Best supportive care in lung cancer trials is inadequately described: a 
systematic review.

Jack B



Palliative Care Institute, Liverpool, UK.

The objective of the paper was to identify and discuss clinical terms associated 
with the availability and delivery of best supportive care for patients with 
lung cancer in randomised controlled clinical trials. Systematic review was 
carried out of relevant studies without language restrictions identified through 
Medline, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science and ISI Proceedings) and 
Cochrane Library. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched to 
identify further studies. Articles describing randomised controlled trials or 
systematic reviews with a comparator arm of best supportive care for patients 
with lung cancer were studied. Definitions of best supportive care and elements 
of best supportive care were reported. Included clinical studies (n = 40) did 
not adequately describe or outline either the components or the delivery of best 
supportive care for patients in lung cancer trials. None of the identified 
studies provided a clear definition of a patient pathway in relation to best 
supportive care, or a clear list of components. Clinical studies are being 
conducted without a clear definition of the best supportive care provided in the 
comparator arms of trials. Inadequate definitions mean that all direct and 
indirect comparisons in trials comparing active treatments with best supportive 
care must be interpreted with caution."

Efficacy and safety of first-line immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in treating 
patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a Bayesian network 
meta-analysis.

Zhang T



Lanzhou, Gansu, China.


College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

BACKGROUND: Despite numerous immunotherapy and chemotherapy regimens available 
for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), it remains 
unclear which regimen is the most effective and safest; relative studies 
comparing such regimens are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
first-line immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy for patients with 
extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. In addition, for the first time, 
comparisons among the first-line systemic regimens on OS and PFS in ES-SCLC by 
each time node were made.
METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google 
Scholars, and ClinicalTrials.gov, and major international conferences were 
searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding comparing 
immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy as first-line treatments for 
patients with advanced ES-SCLC from inception to 1 November. Hazard ratios (HRs) 
and odds ratios (ORs) were generated for dichotomous variants by RStudio 4.2.1. 
The outcomes comprised overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 
objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events of grade 3 or higher (Grade ≥ 
3 AEs).
RESULTS: Eventually, a total of nine RCTs reporting 4,352 individuals with nine 
regimens were enrolled. The regimens were ipilimumabnu (Ipi), atezolizumab 
(Atez), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (Durv-Trem), durvalumab (Durv), 
pembrolizumab (Pemb), adebrelimab (Adeb), serplulimab (Serp), atezolizumab plus 
tiragolumab (Atez-Tira), and nivolumab (Nivo). With regard to OS, serplulimab 
(HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.81) was found to yield the best OS benefit when 
compared with chemotherapy. Meanwhile, serplulimab had the highest probability 
(46.11%) for better OS. Furthermore, compared with chemotherapy, serplulimab 
significantly increased the OS rate from the 6th to the 21st month. With regard 
to PFS, serplulimab (HR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.59) was found to yield the 
best PFS benefit when compared with chemotherapy. Simultaneously, serplulimab 
had the highest probability (94.48%) for better PFS. Serplulimab was also a 
long-lasting first-line regimen in both OS and PFS from a longitudinal 
perspective. In addition, there was no significant difference among the various 
treatment options for ORR and grade ≥3 AEs.
CONCLUSION: Considering OS, PFS, ORR, and safety profiles, serplulimab with 
chemotherapy should be recommended as the best therapy for patients with 
ES-SCLC. Certainly, more head-to-head studies are needed to confirm these 
findings.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the predictive value of intravoxel 
incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) and diffusion kurtosis 
imaging (DKI) quantitative parameters for the response to neoadjuvant 
chemo-immunotherapy (NCIT) in resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients, so as to provide a basis for clinical individualized precision 
treatment.
METHODS: Treatment naive locally advanced NSCLC patients who enrolled in 3 
prospective, open-label, and single-arm clinical trials and received NCIT were 
retrospectively analyzed in this study. Functional MRI imaging was performed at 
baseline and following 3 weeks of treatment as an exploratory endpoint to 
evaluate treatment efficacy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions 
were used to identify independent predictive parameters for NCIT response. 
Prediction models were built with statistically significant quantitative 
parameters and their combinations.
RESULTS: In total of 32 patients, 13 were classified as complete pathological 
response (pCR) and 19 were non-pCR. Post-NCIT ADC, ΔADC, and ΔD values in the 
pCR group were significantly higher than those in the non-pCR group, while the 
pre-NCIT D, post-NCIT Kapp, and ΔKapp were significantly lower than those in 
non-pCR group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that 
pre-NCIT D and post-NCIT Kapp values were independent predictors for NCIT 
response. The combined predictive model, which consisted of IVIM-DWI and DKI, 
showed the best prediction performance with AUC of 0.889.
CONCLUSIONS: The pre-NCIT D, post-NCIT parameters (ADC and Kapp) and Δ 
parameters (ΔADC, ΔD, and ΔKapp) were effective biomarkers for predicting 
pathologic response, and pre-NCIT D and post-NCIT Kapp values were independent 
predictors of NCIT response for NSCLC patients.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This exploratory study indicated that IVIM-DWI and 
DKI MRI imaging would predict pathologic response of neoadjuvant 
chemo-immunotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC patients at initial state and 
early treatment, which could help make clinical individualized treatment 
strategies.
KEY POINTS: • Effective NCIT treatment resulted in increased ADC and D values 
for NSCLC patients. • The residual tumors in non-pCR group tend to have higher 
microstructural complexity and heterogeneity, as measured by Kapp. • Pre-NCIT D 
and post-NCIT Kapp values were independent predictors of NCIT response."

Personalized therapy for lung cancer.

The past decade has seen an enormous advancement in the therapy for lung cancer, 
predominantly seen in adenocarcinoma, ranging from the introduction of 
histology-based drugs to the discovery of targetable mutations. These events 
have led to a personalized therapeutic approach with the delivery of drugs that 
target specific oncogenic pathways active in a given tumor with the intent of 
acquiring the best response rate. The discovery of sensitizing mutation in the 
epidermal growth factor receptor gene as the basis for clinical response to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors led to a systematic search for other molecular 
targets in lung cancer. Currently, there are several molecular alterations that 
can be targeted by experimental drugs. These new discoveries would not be 
possible without a parallel technological evolution in diagnostic molecular 
pathology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a technology that allows for the 
evaluation of multiple molecular alterations in the same sample using a small 
amount of tissue. Selective evaluation of targeted cancer genes, instead of 
whole-genome evaluation, is the approach that is best suited to enter clinical 
practice. This technology allows for the detection of most molecular alteration 
with a single test, thus saving tissue for future discoveries. The use of NGS is 
expected to increase and gain importance in clinical and experimental 
approaches, since it can be used as a diagnostic tool as well as for new 
discoveries. The technique may also help us elucidate the interplay of several 
genes and their alteration in the mechanism of drug response and resistance."

Onartuzumab in lung cancer: the fall of Icarus?

Rolfo C



Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.

The development of targeted therapies has led to a revolution in non-small-cell 
lung cancer, and opened up possibilities for improved personalized medicine. 
With the constant findings of new targets, a lot of inhibitors are being 
developed. However, reliable biomarkers are urgently needed. The design of 
clinical trials needs to become more flexible in order to obtain the best 
results and gain the US FDA/EMEA approval for the new drugs. A recent example of 
a failed trial is the Phase III MetLung trial that compared the effects of the 
c-MET monovalent antibody onartuzumab with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in 
late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Here, we discuss several points as to why 
this trial could have failed."

Geriatric oncology is a rapidly expanding domain because of the deep 
epidemiological changes of the last decades related to the ageing of the 
population. Lung cancer treatment in patients 75 years and over is a major issue 
of thoracic oncology. Curative surgery remains the treatment offering the best 
survival rates to the patient whatever his age. The important variability 
observed within the elderly forces us to take into account their specificities, 
in particular for ageing physiology and associated comorbidities. Thus, 
preoperative workup permitting to assess the resectability of the tumor but also 
the operability of the patient is all the more essential in the advanced age 
that it must be adapted to the particular characteristics of the elderly. Thanks 
to recent data of the literature, morbidity and mortality associated to surgical 
treatment are now better characterized and considered as acceptable in 
accordance with long-term survival. Clinical investigation remains essential to 
acquire a better knowledge of potential benefit of multimodal treatments in the 
elderly, for which very few data are available."

Despite the advantages offered by personalized treatments, there is presently no 
way to predict response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). In this exploratory study, we investigated the application 
of deep learning techniques to histological tissue slides (deep pathomics), with 
the aim of predicting the response to therapy in stage III NSCLC. We evaluated 
35 digitalized tissue slides (biopsies or surgical specimens) obtained from 
patients with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC. Patients were classified as responders 
(12/35, 34.7%) or non-responders (23/35, 65.7%) based on the target volume 
reduction shown on weekly CT scans performed during chemoradiation treatment. 
Digital tissue slides were tested by five pre-trained convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs)-AlexNet, VGG, MobileNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-using a leave-two 
patient-out cross validation approach, and we evaluated the networks' 
performances. GoogLeNet was globally found to be the best CNN, correctly 
classifying 8/12 responders and 10/11 non-responders. Moreover, Deep-Pathomics 
was found to be highly specific (TNr: 90.1) and quite sensitive (TPr: 0.75). Our 
data showed that AI could surpass the capabilities of all presently available 
diagnostic systems, supplying additional information beyond that currently 
obtainable in clinical practice. The ability to predict a patient's response to 
treatment could guide the development of new and more effective therapeutic 
AI-based approaches and could therefore be considered an effective and 
innovative step forward in personalised medicine.

Advances in the use of surgery and multimodality treatment for N2 non-small cell 
lung cancer.

Van Schil PE

Edegem (Antwerp) , Belgium.

Manchester , Manchester , UK.

Stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous 
group of bronchogenic carcinomas with locoregional involvement. Different 
categories of N2 disease exist, ranging from unexpectedly encountered N2 
involvement after detailed preoperative staging or 'surprise' N2, to potentially 
resectable disease treated within a combined modality setting, and finally, 
bulky N2 involvement treated by chemoradiation. Areas covered: Large randomised 
controlled trials and meta-analyses on stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC have been published 
but their implications for treatment remain a matter of debate. No definite 
recommendations can be provided as diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms vary 
according to local, national or international guidelines. Expert commentary: 
From the literature, it is clear that patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC should 
be treated by combined modality therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and 
surgery. The relative contribution of each modality has not been firmly 
established. For patients undergoing induction therapy, adequate restaging is 
important as only down-staged patients will clearly benefit from surgical 
resection. Each patient should be discussed within a multidisciplinary team to 
determine the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach according to the specific 
local expertise. In the near future, it might be expected that targeted 
therapies and immunotherapy will be incorporated as possible therapeutic 
options."

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) is controversial. We aimed to address this important issue through a 
Bayesian network meta-analysis.
METHODS: We performed a search of electronic databases for randomized controlled 
trials comparing the following treatments: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, 
and their multiple combinations before March 25, 2018. Pooled data on overall 
survival and treatment-related deaths were analyzed within the Bayesian 
framework.
RESULTS: Eighteen eligible trials reporting 13 treatments were included. In 
terms of overall survival, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and 
adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which tended to be consistent (hazard 
ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.21 to 5.93), ranked superior to 
other treatments. Notably, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and 
adjuvant radiotherapy was significantly more effective in prolonging survival 
than surgery alone (HR 0.38, 95% CrI 0.18 to 0.81), surgery plus adjuvant 
radiotherapy (HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.29 to 0.92) and potentially surgery plus 
adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.23 to 1.05). Overall, with 29% as the 
highest possibility of causing the fewest treatment-related deaths, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was 
the safest treatment option.
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy has the greatest possibility to be the optimal 
treatment with the best overall survival and fewest treatment-related deaths for 
stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC.

Treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the elderly.

Sequist LV



Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA. LVSequist@Partners.org

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is primarily a disease of the elderly. 
Although NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the 
overall prognosis of this disease is poor, treatment improves survival compared 
with best supportive care, independent of the stage of disease. Elderly patients 
have a particularly poor prognosis with NSCLC compared with younger patients, 
likely due to age-related biases in referral and treatment patterns. There is an 
emerging literature regarding the tolerability of NSCLC treatments in elderly 
patients. In advanced disease, subgroup analyses of the elderly population 
participating in randomized clinical trials as well as elder-specific 
prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that elderly NSCLC patients 
derive equivalent survival benefit from the treatment of NSCLC as younger 
patients. This treatment is tolerable for ""fit"" elderly patients, and modified 
regimens are available for the more frail elderly patients. Evaluating the 
relative fitness of an elderly patient may be achieved through an assessment of 
functional ability. As the U.S. population ages and the incidence of NSCLC 
rises, an understanding of treatment options for elderly patients with NSCLC is 
vital for all clinicians involved in their clinical care."

BACKGROUND: This review describes a new therapeutic landscape in the adjuvant 
treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and discusses the 
role of the surgeon in ensuring the best outcomes within this treatment 
paradigm.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative literature review using the search terms 
""non-small cell lung cancer"" and ""adjuvant"" to identify randomized Phase III 
trials of systemic adjuvant therapy for NSCLC through March 17, 2022. We also 
searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials of adjuvant 
immunotherapies and targeted therapies for NSCLC.
RESULTS: Three recent randomized Phase III trials reported significant 
improvements in disease-free survival with adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors 
or targeted therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC: IMpower010 (atezolizumab 
vs best supportive care; NCT02486718), KEYNOTE-091 (PEARLS) (pembrolizumab vs 
placebo; NCT02504372), and ADAURA (osimertinib vs placebo; NCT02511106). 
Numerous other Phase III trials evaluating adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors 
and targeted therapies are currently underway, many of which demonstrate an 
evolution of trial design and end points for adjuvant therapy trials. This 
rapidly changing treatment landscape requires a shift in the role of the surgeon 
to facilitate appropriate biomarker screening for planning of the perioperative 
period and molecular testing of the surgical specimen to guide adjuvant therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: After decades of stagnation in the management of NSCLC, recent 
results with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies are ushering in 
a new era of precision medicine in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage NSCLC. 
Surgeons have an important role in facilitating multidisciplinary care in this 
rapidly evolving landscape.

Vaccines for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a renewed anticancer 
strategy.

Gridelli C



cgridelli@libero.it

Carcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constituting about 85% of all new diagnoses. 
Standard approaches for each NSCLC stage have reached a plateau in 
effectiveness. A variety of novel approaches are now being investigated to 
improve the outcome of this disease. Despite decades of research, no specific 
active cancer vaccine has, to date, been approved for NSCLC therapy; 
nevertheless, vaccine therapy has recently re-emerged as a potential therapeutic 
approach. In particular, several new paradigms have stemmed from recent clinical 
findings both in the use of combination therapy approaches with more 
sophisticated specific vaccines and in clinical trial design and endpoint 
analyses. Several vaccine therapies have been investigated in NSCLC, including 
in the early and advanced disease stages. The best results appear to be in the 
adjuvant settings and in locally advanced NSCLC. In fact, in these two settings, 
phase III randomized trials are ongoing evaluating the melanoma-associated 
antigen A3 vaccine and the liposomal BLP25 vaccine. This paper reviews the main 
clinical trials involving several different cancer vaccines employed in the 
treatment of early and advanced stage NSCLC, focusing on those in advanced 
stages of development."

Pharmacoeconomic evaluations in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Carlson JJ



Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) creates a large economic and disease burden 
worldwide. In an era of evidence-based medicine and increasing cost pressures, 
it is important to understand the relative clinical and economic impact of the 
many drug treatment strategies available for NSCLC. A systematic review of the 
peer-reviewed literature for pharmacoeconomic evaluations in the primary 
treatment of NSCLC published over the past decade (1 June 1997 to 1 June 2007) 
was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Harvard Review of 
Economic Analyses, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and 
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health databases. A total of 19 
studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these studies, 58% were 
cost-effectiveness studies, 37% were cost-minimization studies and 5% were 
cost-utility studies. Most were from the EU (63%), were from the payer 
perspective (89%), were in advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC (84%) and were funded 
by drug manufacturers (68%). Drug treatments generally were found to be cost 
effective compared with best supportive care. In addition, cisplatin alone or in 
combination appeared to provide better value than carboplatin alone or in 
combination. We did not identify any studies of recently approved therapeutics 
(e.g. erlotinib or bevacizumab). The quality of studies varied but the majority 
did not meet recommended guidelines for economic evaluations, with only 43% 
using direct comparisons, 5% of studies being cost-utility studies and 26% using 
either statistical analysis of patient-level data or probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses. In conclusion, there are a multitude of studies examining drug 
treatment for NSCLC; however, few of these utilized methodological approaches 
consistent with recommended guidelines. Despite these limitations, it appears 
that drug therapy compared with no treatment provides reasonable value for 
money, but carrying out more detailed comparisons of various agents is 
challenging. Given the absence of studies on newer therapeutics and the lack of 
cost-utility studies, additional studies are warranted."

Intravascular Treatment Techniques for Locoregional Therapies of Lung Tumors.

[Article in English, German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Vogl TJ



Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.


BACKGROUND: Lung cancer incidence has greatly increased over the past century. 
Moreover, the lung is the most common site of metastatic involvement. Despite 
improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of lung malignancies, patient 
prognosis is still unsatisfactory. Locoregional chemotherapeutic techniques for 
the treatment of lung malignancies are the current focus of research. The aim of 
this review article is to present different locoregional intravascular 
techniques and their treatment principles and to assess the pros and cons of 
each of them as a palliative and neoadjuvant treatment method in the treatment 
of lung malignancy.
METHOD: The different methods for the treatment of malignant lung lesions such 
as isolated lung perfusion (ILP), selective pulmonary artery perfusion (SPAP), 
transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE), bronchial artery infusion (BAI), 
bronchioarterial chemoembolization (BACE), and intraarteriel chemoperfusion 
(IACP) are evaluated comparatively.
RESULTS: Locoregional intravascular chemotherapy procedures are proving to be 
promising treatment options in the management of malignant lung tumors. In order 
to achieve optimal results, the locoregional technique should be used to achieve 
the highest possible uptake of the chemotherapeutic agent into the target tissue 
with rapid systemic clearance.
CONCLUSION: Among the various treatment options for lung malignancies, TPCE is 
the best evaluated treatment concept. However, further studies are necessary to 
define the optimal treatment concept with the best clinical outcomes.
KEY POINTS: · There are various intravascular chemotherapy methods for the 
treatment of lung malignancies.. · Transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE) is 
currently the most extensively evaluated treatment method for lung 
malignancies.. · Thermoablation after neoadjuvant chemoperfusion is a promising 
therapy for treating lung malignancies..

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Die Inzidenz von Lungenkarzinomen hat im letzten 
Jahrhundert stark zugenommen. Darüber hinaus ist die Lunge der häufigste Ort der 
Metastasierung. Trotz der verbesserten Diagnostik und Therapie von 
Lungenmalignomen ist die Prognose der Patienten noch immer unbefriedigend. 
Lokoregionäre chemotherapeutische Techniken zur Behandlung von Lungenmalignomen 
haben heutzutage die Aufmerksamkeit der Forschung auf sich gezogen. Ziel dieses 
Übersichtsartikels ist es, verschiedene lokoregionale intravaskuläre Techniken 
und deren Behandlungsprinzipien vorzustellen und die jeweiligen Vor- und 
Nachteile als palliative und neoadjuvante Behandlungsmethode bei der Behandlung 
von Lungenmalignomen zu evaluieren.
METHODE: Die verschiedenen Verfahren bei der Behandlung von Lungenmalignomen wie 
isolierte Lungenperfusion (ILP), selektive pulmonale Arterienperfusion (SPAP), 
transpulmonale Chemoembolisation (TPCE), Bronchialarterieninfusion (BAI), 
Bronchialarterienchemoembolisation (BACE) und intraarterielle Chemoperfusion 
(IACP) werden vergleichend bewertet.
ERGEBNISSE: Lokoregionale intravaskuläre Chemotherapieverfahren erweisen sich 
als vielversprechende Behandlungsoptionen bei der Behandlung von malignen 
Lungentumoren. Um optimale Ergebnisse zu erreichen, sollte mittels 
lokoregionaler Technik eine möglichst hohe Aufnahme des Chemotherapeutikums in 
das Zielgewebe mit schneller systemischer Clearance erzielt werden.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Unter den verschiedenen Behandlungsoptionen bei 
Lungenmalignomen ist die TPCE das am besten evaluierte Behandlungskonzept. 
Allerdings sind weitere Studien nötig, um das optimale Behandlungskonzept mit 
den besten klinischen Ergebnissen zu definieren.

Understanding the role of Toll-like receptors in lung cancer immunity and 
immunotherapy.

Hoden B



Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, United States.

Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, United States.

Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. 
Significant improvements in lung cancer therapeutics have relied on a better 
understanding of lung cancer immunity and the development of novel 
immunotherapies, as best exemplified by the introduction of PD-1/PD-L1-based 
therapies. However, this improvement is limited to lung cancer patients who 
respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Further improvements in immunotherapy may 
benefit from a better understanding of innate immune response mechanisms in the 
lung. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a key component of the innate immune 
response and mediate the early recognition of pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). TLR signaling 
modulates the tumor microenvironment from ""cold"" to ""hot"" leading to immune 
sensitization of tumor cells to treatments and improved patient prognosis. In 
addition, TLR signaling activates the adaptive immune response to improve the 
response to cancer immunotherapy through the regulation of anti-tumor T cell 
activity. This review will highlight recent progress in our understanding of the 
role of TLRs in lung cancer immunity and immunotherapy.

In this review article we discuss the diagnostic workup and current treatment 
strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anatomical resection and 
systematic lymph node dissection is the recommended treatment for early-stage 
NSCLC. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative for non-operable 
patients. Locally advanced NSCLC could be treated with a combination of 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, and in select cases followed by 
surgical resection. Treatment for patients with metastasized NSCLC depends on 
molecular tumor characteristics, PD-L1 expression and could consist of 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or a combination of these 
modalities. In all stages, best supportive care is an option to consider. 
Because of the success of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for stage IV NSCLC, 
numerous trials have started to investigate the efficacy of these modalities in 
early-stage NSCLC as well, further optimizing treatment strategies for this 
patient group."

Lung cancer had an estimated incidence of 221,200 in 2015, making up 13% of all 
cancer diagnoses. Tumor ablation is an important treatment option for 
nonsurgical lung cancer and pulmonary metastatic patients. Radiofrequency 
ablation has been used for over a decade with newer modalities, microwave 
ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation presenting as 
additional and possibly improved treatment options for patients. This minimally 
invasive therapy is best for small primary lesions or favorably located 
metastatic tumors. These technologies can offer palliation and sometimes cure of 
thoracic malignancies. This article discusses the current available technologies 
and techniques available for tumor ablation."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately one in five 
cancer-related deaths, and management requires increasingly complex decision 
making by health care professionals. Many centers have therefore adopted a 
multidisciplinary approach to patient care, using the expertise of various 
specialists to provide the best evidence-based, personalized treatment. However, 
increasingly complex disease staging, as well as expanded biomarker testing and 
multimodality management algorithms with novel therapeutics, have driven the 
need for multifaceted, collaborative decision making to optimally guide the 
overall treatment process. To keep up with the rapidly evolving treatment 
landscape, national-level guidelines have been introduced to standardize patient 
pathways and ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment. Such strategies depend on 
efficient and effective communication between relevant multidisciplinary team 
members and have both improved adherence to treatment guidelines and extended 
patient survival. This article highlights the value of a multidisciplinary 
approach to diagnosis and staging, treatment decision making, and adverse event 
management in NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review highlights the value 
of a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and staging of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and makes practical suggestions as to how multidisciplinary 
teams (MDTs) can be best deployed at individual stages of the disease to improve 
patient outcomes and effectively manage common adverse events. The authors 
discuss how a collaborative approach, appropriately leveraging the diverse 
expertise of NSCLC MDT members (including specialist radiation and medical 
oncologists, chest physicians, pathologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, and 
nursing staff) can continue to ensure optimal per-patient decision making as 
treatment options become ever more specialized in the era of biomarker-driven 
therapeutic strategies.

The COVID-19 pandemic, characterised by a fast and global spread during the 
first months of 2020, has prompted the development of a structured set of 
recommendations for cancer care management, to maintain the highest possible 
standards. Within this framework, it is crucial to ensure no disruption to 
essential oncological services and guarantee the optimal care.This is a 
structured proposal for the management of lung cancer, comprising three levels 
of priorities, namely: tier 1 (high priority), tier 2 (medium priority) and tier 
3 (low priority)-defined according to the criteria of the Cancer Care Ontario, 
Huntsman Cancer Institute and Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.The manuscript 
emphasises the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and 
reconsiders all steps from diagnosis, staging and treatment.These 
recommendations should, therefore, serve as guidance for prioritising the 
different aspects of cancer care to mitigate the possible negative impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the management of our patients.As the situation is rapidly 
evolving, practical actions are required to guarantee the best patients' 
treatment while protecting and respecting their rights, safety and well-being. 
In this environment, cancer practitioners have great responsibilities: provide 
timely, appropriate, compassionate and justified cancer care, while protecting 
themselves and their patients from being infected with COVID-19. In case of 
shortages, resources must be distributed fairly. Consequently, the following 
recommendations can be applied with significant nuances, depending on the time 
and location for their use, considering variable constraints imposed to the 
health systems. An exceptional flexibility is required from cancer caregivers.

Preoperative rehabilitation for thoracic surgery.

Templeton R



Manchester, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung resection provides the best outcome for patients with 
early stage lung cancer. However, lung cancer surgery carries a significant risk 
of perioperative complications. Patient risk may be reduced by addressing 
modifiable risk factors in the preoperative period. We review how this can be 
achieved through preoperative rehabilitation pathways.
RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiorespiratory fitness is an independent predictor of 
survival for nonsmall cell cancer. Preoperative exercise programmes may improve 
cardiorespiratory reserve and reduce perioperative complications. Additional 
benefits may be achieved through interventions such as smoking cessation 
programmes, correction of anaemia, improvement of nutritional status and 
improved oral hygiene. These interventions may also have the additional benefit 
of enabling high-risk patients previously deemed unsuitable for surgery to be 
optimized to such a degree that they can undergo surgery. These interventions 
will achieve maximal benefit when delivered early in lung cancer pathways; this 
requires close collaboration amongst multidisciplinary teams.
SUMMARY: Lung cancer surgery carries significant risk of postoperative pulmonary 
complications. Through integrating prehabilitation interventions into lung 
cancer pathways, there are opportunities to improve long-term outcomes for 
patients."
