Our study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior medical students can actively contribute to QA processes as part of an undergraduate day surgery educational programme.', 'Health care delivery has undertaken a major shift from inpatient management to ambulatory surgical care with increasing emphasis on quality assurance (QA) processes. Educational opportunities for medical undergraduate programmes are being sought in the day surgery environment. Our study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior medical students can actively contribute to the QA processes as part of an undergraduate day surgery educational programme.', 'Fifty-nine final year medical students followed allocated patients with common surgical conditions through all phases of the day surgery process. Students kept records about each case in a log book and also presented their cases at weekly Problem Based Learning tutorials. An audit of student log books and review of tutorial records was conducted for the 1996 and 1997 academic years, in order to evaluate student contribution to QA.', 'Students followed 621 cases, representing a sampling of 14. 1% day surgery cases. Categories of problems highlighted by students included inappropriate patient and procedure selection, inadequate pain management, discharge, communication and resource issues. Students made a number of recommendations including the development of multilingual videotapes and patient information sheets for non-English speaking patients, avoidance of bilateral surgical procedures and improved links with local medical officers. They also developed new guidelines and protocols.'], 'labels': ['CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES', 'SUBJECTS AND METHODS', 'SUBJECTS AND METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'Australia', 'Humans', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Students, Medical'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}\n",

One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue.', 'No changes were detected in the control group.
