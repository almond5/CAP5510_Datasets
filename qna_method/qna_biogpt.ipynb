Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1].

Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.', 'Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study.
