The analysis of the causes that have given rise to a change in tendency in the 
incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer in the last few decades generates 
important revelations regarding the role of breast screening, the regular 
application of adjuvant therapies and the change of risk factors. The benefits 
of early detection have been accompanied by certain adverse effects, even in 
terms of an excessive number of prophylactic mastectomies. Recently, several 
updates have been published on the recommendations in breast cancer screening at 
an international level. On the other hand, the advances in genomics have made it 
possible to establish a new molecular classification of breast cancer. Our aim 
is to present an updated overview of the epidemiological situation of breast 
cancer, as well as some relevant issues from the point of view of diagnosis, 
such as molecular classification and different strategies for both 
population-based and opportunistic screening.

Globally, breast cancer is both the most commonly occurring cancer and the 
commonest cause of cancer death among women. Available data suggest that 
incidence and mortality in high-resource countries has been declining whereas 
incidence and mortality in low-resource countries has been increasing. This 
pattern is likely to be due to changing risk factor profiles and differences in 
access to breast cancer early detection and treatment. Risk factors for breast 
cancer include increasing age, race, menarche history, breast characteristics, 
reproductive patterns, hormone use, alcohol use, tobacco use, diet, physical 
activity, and body habitus. Mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 tumor suppressor 
genes are significantly associated with the development of breast and ovarian 
cancer by the age of 70. Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. 
As there are few signs and symptoms early on, early detection is an important 
strategy to improve outcomes. Major professional organizations in the United 
States and elsewhere recommend screening with mammography with appropriate 
follow up for an abnormal screening test, although they differ somewhat by 
recommended ages and frequency of screening. Studies suggest a 15%-40% mortality 
reduction secondary to screening, however, there are also concerns about harms, 
such as overdiagnosis (5%-54%) and overtreatment leading to long term 
complications, and false negatives (6%-46%). Identification of women at risk for 
BRCA1 and BRCA 2 mutations is also recommended with referral for genetic 
testing. Preventive interventions, such as lifestyle, medical, and surgical 
options are available for women testing positive for BRCA mutations.

Breast cancer is a complex disease which is found as the second cause of 
cancer-associated death among women. Accumulating of evidence indicated that 
various factors (i.e., gentical and envirmental factors) could be associated 
with initiation and progression of breast cancer. Diagnosis of breast cancer 
patients in early stages is one of important aspects of breast cancer treatment. 
Among of various diagnosis platforms, imaging techniques are main diagnosis 
approaches which could provide valuable data on patients with breast cancer. It 
has been showed that various imaging techniques such as mammography, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), positron-emission tomography (PET), Computed tomography 
(CT), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could be used for 
diagnosis and monitoring patients with breast cancer in various stages. Beside, 
imaging techniques, utilization of biochemical biomarkers such as proteins, 
DNAs, mRNAs, and microRNAs could be employed as new diagnosis and therapeutic 
tools for patients with breast cancer. Here, we summarized various imaging 
techniques and biochemical biomarkers could be utilized as diagnosis of patients 
with breast cancer. Moreover, we highlighted microRNAs and exosomes as new 
diagnosis and therapeutic biomarkers for monitoring patients with breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the highest public detected cancer among female population in 
the majority of countries worldwide. Breast self-examination (BSE) is a useful 
screening tool to empower women and raise awareness about their breast tissues 
and help detect any breast abnormalities when they occur. This study aimed to 
assess the level of female university students' knowledge and practice of BSE. A 
self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge about breast 
cancer and related items, and an observation checklist was used to test 
practicing BSE using a breast simulator. Eighty-six students participated in the 
study, 58.1% studying nursing and 41.9% studying clinical nutrition in the third 
(40.7%) or the fourth level (59.3%). Of them, 24.4% had previous family history 
of breast cancer. The majority of the students (80.2%) had previous information 
about breast cancer acquired from different sources, university studies (57%), 
the Internet (45%), and social media (41%). Findings showed good scores (≥70%) 
regarding signs and symptoms and risk factors of breast cancer; however, low 
knowledge scores (<70%) were detected regarding general knowledge about breast 
cancer disease, methods of early detection and management, and applying steps of 
practicing BSE. Roughly all the students (96.5%) have heard about BSE, and 69.8% 
knew the time to do BSE; however, only 31.4% practice it regularly. Three 
barriers to practice were dominant among students who do not have a breast 
problem (39.7%), do not know how to do it (37.9%), and being busy 31%. On the 
other hand, breast cancer early detection purpose and the presence of family 
history of breast cancer were considered facilitators to regular practice BSE. A 
statistically significant relationship existed between knowledge about the steps 
of applying the BSE and regular practicing. A training program should be 
implemented to increase the level of awareness about BC and practicing BSE.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer in women aged less than 
40. However, organized screening of young healthy women has been recognized as 
inefficient and even deleterious by most experts [1], and should not been 
offered. Individualized screening, targeting only some young high-risk women, 
may be beneficial although no randomized trial has proven an impact on breast 
cancer mortality. All recommendations are based on expert's opinions. This 
review offers a toned overview of these recommendations and underlines the need 
of careful information and shared decision with each patient.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to provide an updated overview of the 
indications for diagnostic breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), discusses 
the available and novel imaging exams proposed for breast cancer detection, and 
discusses considerations when performing breast MRI in the clinical setting.
RECENT FINDINGS: Breast MRI is superior in identifying lesions in women with a 
very high risk of breast cancer or average risk with dense breasts. Moreover, 
the application of breast MRI has benefits in numerous other clinical cases as 
well; e.g., the assessment of the extent of disease, evaluation of response to 
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), evaluation of lymph nodes and primary occult tumor, 
evaluation of lesions suspicious of Paget's disease, and suspicious discharge 
and breast implants. Breast cancer is the most frequently detected tumor among 
women around the globe and is often diagnosed as a result of abnormal findings 
on mammography. Although effective multimodal therapies significantly decline 
mortality rates, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer 
death. A proactive approach to identifying suspicious breast lesions at early 
stages can enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments, improve patient 
recovery, and significantly improve long-term survival. However, the currently 
applied mammography to detect breast cancer has its limitations. High 
false-positive and false-negative rates are observed in women with dense 
breasts. Since approximately half of the screening population comprises women 
with dense breasts, mammography is often incorrectly used. The application of 
breast MRI should significantly impact the correct cases of breast abnormality 
detection in women. Radiomics provides valuable data obtained from breast MRI, 
further improving breast cancer diagnosis. Introducing these constantly evolving 
algorithms in clinical practice will lead to the right breast detection tool, 
optimized surveillance program, and individualized breast cancer treatment.

Developing countries have limited healthcare resources and use different 
strategies to diagnose breast cancer. Most of the population depends on the 
public healthcare system, which affects the diagnosis of the tumor. Thus, the 
indicators observed in developed countries cannot be directly compared with 
those observed in developing countries because the healthcare infrastructures in 
developing countries are deficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate breast 
cancer screening strategies and indicators in developing countries. A systematic 
review and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Timing, and 
Setting methodology were performed to identify possible indicators of 
presentation at diagnosis and the methodologies used in developing countries. We 
searched PubMed for the terms ""Breast Cancer"" or ""Breast Cancer Screening"" and 
""Developing Country"" or ""Developing Countries"". In all, 1,149 articles were 
identified. Of these articles, 45 full articles were selected, which allowed us 
to identify indicators related to epidemiology, diagnostic intervention 
(diagnostic strategy, diagnostic infrastructure, percentage of women undergoing 
mammography), quality of intervention (presentation of symptoms at diagnosis, 
time to diagnosis, early stage disease), comparisons (trend curves, 
subpopulations at risk) and survival among different countries. The 
identification of these indicators will improve the reporting of methodologies 
used in developing countries and will allow us to evaluate improvements in 
public health related to breast cancer.

Background: Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women in the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE). Many young women in the UAE have poor knowledge 
about breast cancer screening, including risk factors and warning 
signs/symptoms. We investigated awareness about breast cancer and breast 
self-examination (BSE) as a screening tool among female students at the 
University of Sharjah, UAE. Methods: This study used a cross sectional survey 
design. Participants were 241 undergraduate female students (aged ≥18 years) 
from three University of Sharjah campuses. Data were collected from March to 
April 2017 using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire covered: 
sociodemographic characteristics; knowledge about breast cancer, risk factors, 
and warning signs/symptoms; and knowledge and practice of BSE. Data were 
analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson’s chi-square tests. Results: 
About 38.6% of participants were from the Medical campus, 37.3% were from the 
Women’s campus, and 24% were from the Fine Arts and Design campus. Most (99%) 
participants had heard of breast cancer. About 50% were knowledgeable about the 
risk factors, but only 38% were knowledgeable about warning signs/symptoms. The 
most commonly identified risk factors were family and personal histories of 
breast cancer, and the most commonly identified warning sign/symptom was breast 
lump. There was a significant association between knowledge about risk factors 
and campus type. Participants from the Medical campus were more knowledgeable 
about risk factors than participants from the other two campuses. Overall, 68.5% 
of participants had heard of BSE, but few participants actually performed BSE. 
Reasons for not performing BSE included “forgetting” and “not knowing how.” 
Conclusions: Although most participants were aware of breast cancer, knowledge 
about risk factors and warning signs/symptoms was relatively poor. Knowledge 
about performing BSE was particularly low. This highlights the importance of 
increasing awareness about breast cancer and BSE among young women in the UAE.

INTRODUCTION: Most symptomatic women with breast cancer have relatively short 
diagnostic intervals but a substantial minority experience prolonged journeys to 
diagnosis. Atypical presentations (with symptoms other than breast lump) may be 
responsible.
METHODS: We examined the presenting symptoms of breast cancer in women using 
data from a national audit initiative (n=2316). Symptoms were categorised 
topographically. We investigated variation in the length of the patient interval 
(time from symptom onset to presentation) and the primary care interval (time 
from presentation to specialist referral) across symptom groups using 
descriptive analyses and quantile regression.
RESULTS: A total of 56 presenting symptoms were described: breast lump was the 
most frequent (83%) followed by non-lump breast symptoms, (e.g. nipple 
abnormalities (7%) and breast pain (6%)); and non-breast symptoms (e.g. back 
pain (1%) and weight loss (0.3%)). Greater proportions of women with 'non-lump 
only' and 'both lump and non-lump' symptoms waited 90days or longer before 
seeking help compared to those with 'breast lump only' (15% and 20% vs. 7% 
respectively). Quantile regression indicated that the differences in the patient 
interval persisted after adjusting for age and ethnicity, but there was little 
variation in primary care interval for the majority of women.
CONCLUSIONS: About 1 in 6 women with breast cancer present with a large spectrum 
of symptoms other than breast lump. Women who present with non-lump breast 
symptoms tend to delay seeking help. Further emphasis of breast symptoms other 
than breast lump in symptom awareness campaigns is warranted.

INTRODUCTION: In the absence of monitoring programs, those at risk of developing 
breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) must detect its development. However, 
the efficacy of self-assessment for BCRL has not been widely investigated. This 
study will determine if symptoms and signs of BCRL are associated with 
lymphoedema detected by bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) and whether those with 
and without BCRL can accurately assess the signs of its presence.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with a history of breast cancer (n = 100) 
reported the presence/absence of symptoms associated with upper limb BCRL and 
underwent assessment for pitting oedema and differences in tissue texture 
between their arms (pinch). BIS detected BCRL in 48 women. Women were more 
likely to have BIS-detected BCRL if they reported swelling (odds ratio (OR), 
58.8; 95% CI, 4.9 to 709.4; p = 0.001) or had inter-limb tissue texture 
differences in their forearm (OR, 73.5; 95% CI, 7.3 to 736.9; p = < 0.001) or 
upper arm (OR, 23.9; 95% CI, 2.8 to 201.7; p = 0.003). Agreement between 
therapist and self-assessment of signs of BCRL was almost perfect (kappa, 0.819 
to 0.940). A combination of self-reported swelling and/or self-assessed forearm 
tissue texture difference identified all cases of BIS-detected BCRL.
CONCLUSION: Participants accurately identified the presence or absence of 
physical signs of BCRL in their arm. Perceived swelling and differences in 
tissue texture in the affected arm were associated with, and sensitive to, 
BIS-detected BCRL. These findings support the use of self-assessment to 
determine if BCRL is developing, indicating the need for professional 
assessment.

Overdetection of Breast Cancer.

Overdetection (often referred to as overdiagnosis) of cancer is the detection of 
disease, such as through a screening program, that would otherwise remain occult 
through an individual's life. In the context of screening, this could occur for 
cancers that were slow growing or indolent, or simply because an unscreened 
individual would have died from some other cause before the cancer had surfaced 
clinically. The main harm associated with overdetection is the subsequent 
overdiagnosis and overtreatment of disease. In this article, the phenomenon is 
reviewed, the methods of estimation of overdetection are discussed and reasons 
for variability in such estimates are given, with emphasis on an analysis using 
Canadian data. Microsimulation modeling is used to illustrate the expected time 
course of cancer detection that gives rise to overdetection. While overdetection 
exists, the actual amount is likely to be much lower than the estimate used by 
the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Furthermore, the issue is of 
greater significance in older rather than younger women due to competing causes 
of death. The particular challenge associated with in situ breast cancer is 
considered and possible approaches to avoiding overtreatment are suggested.

Organized national mammographic screening has been adopted as the gold standard 
for breast cancer early detection in western countries; however it may not be 
the most cost-effective approach to early detection in low and middle income 
countries (LMC) as it is very demanding in terms of human and financial 
resources. Moreover, its benefit to harm ratio has been questioned lately, 
particularly in women <50 years, the age group which produces the majority of 
breast cancer cases in LMC. In the past few years, evidence about alternatives 
to mammographic screening that would benefit LMC populations have been produced. 
They are reviewed and discussed in the present paper, together with evidence 
about mammographic screening relevant to LMC. Alternative screening tests 
(clinical breast-exam and self breast-exam) are examined, then the pro- and 
cons- for various strategies (opportunistic screening, population based 
screening and clinical downstaging) are discussed.

Breast cancer is common in the elderly, as more than 50% of these tumors are 
diagnosed in patients aged 65 years or older. Elderly women may also delay 
reporting or underreport to their physician suspicious symptoms and lesions, so 
that breast cancer is more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage, with 
putatively inferior outcomes. Adjuvant hormonal therapy has clear benefits for 
all women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, despite the fact 
that it is still under-prescribed in elderly women, but the benefits of 
tamoxifen are more evident than that observed in younger patients. Aromatase 
inhibitors significantly prolong disease-free survival, reducing the risk of 
metastases and contralateral cancer compared with tamoxifen, and these benefits 
are greater in women aged ≥65 years. However, in case of a history of 
pathological fractures, arthritis or chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes, 
tamoxifen still represents the preferred adjuvant option. In patients with a 
high risk of recurrence with hormonal therapy alone, the cardiac toxicity of 
nonanthracycline regimens should be taken into account. Trastuzumab-based 
therapy should be offered to most patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors. 
Older patients have an increased risk of disease recurrence and cancer-related 
mortality, because they are usually undertreated due to their age and longevity. 
Thus, a multidisciplinary geriatric approach is required, but the optimal 
management of these patients is still not well defined.

AIM: To provide a comprehensive overview of breast cancer in Colombia.
METHODS: Data on breast cancer in Colombia are scarce. We present incidence data 
from population-based cancer registries that represent 4 distinct regions of the 
country. Other data originate from non-governmental institutions and healthcare 
providers within Colombia, official sources, expert opinion, Colombian 
legislation, and the Cancer Mortality Atlas publishes by Colombian National 
Cancer Institute.
RESULTS: In Colombia, the age-standardized incidence rate remained relatively 
stable between 2012 and 2020 (43.1 to 47.8 cases per 100,000 women-years); 
Additionally, survival since 1995 has presented a substantial improvement from 
65.7 to 72.1. In 33% of cases, the diagnosis of breast cancer was made in 
advanced stages, stage III or higher. The health demography survey conducted in 
2015 showed that the participation in mammography screening in women aged 40 to 
69 remains low 48.1%. Some limitations regarding access to early detection and 
diagnosis include economic strata, health insurance coverage, origin, and 
accessibility. On average, a 90-day period was reported from onset of symptoms 
to diagnosis of breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: The first action towards improving outcomes in breast cancer should 
be to improve stage at diagnosis and timely access to care.

PURPOSE: The frequency and types of breast symptoms reported by women in the 
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) have never 
been characterized. This study aims to establish the frequency of reported 
symptoms and the diagnostic outcomes associated with reported symptoms.
METHODS: We examined the frequency of symptoms reported prior to mammography 
using medical record abstraction data from women in the NBCCEDP. We also 
calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of having an abnormal mammogram, an 
abnormal clinical breast examination, or a final diagnosis of breast cancer by 
symptoms, compared to asymptomatic women.
RESULTS: In our sample of women, 10.3 % reported at least one symptom. Women 
with symptoms were younger and more likely to be non-Hispanic white. Among those 
reporting symptoms, breast lump (31.7 %) and pain or tenderness (49.3 %) was 
most common. A relatively low proportion of women with symptoms were diagnosed 
with in situ (0.9 %) or invasive breast cancer (4.3 %). However, a self-reported 
breast lump [aOR 13.7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7.8-24.1], inflammation or 
changes to the skin/nipple (aOR 27.8; 95 % CI 8.7-88.8), and other or 
unspecified symptoms (aOR 3.4; 95 % CI 2.1-7.5) were associated with an 
increased risk of invasive breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of breast cancer among women reporting 
symptoms is relatively low, knowing which symptoms carry the highest breast 
cancer risk is important to assist in appropriate diagnostic workup.

Breast Cancer Screening in Men.

Breast cancer screening has been highly successful in women in reducing 
mortality through early detection. In comparison, clinical detection of breast 
cancer remains the norm in men, and delay in diagnosis is reflected by a 
persistent survival disparity compared to women despite advances in modern 
therapy. Male breast cancer presents an interesting dilemma. While mammography 
is highly sensitive and specific for male breast cancer, routine screening is 
not justified by the overall low disease incidence. Yet there has been interest 
in leveraging mammography in targeted screening of men with identifiable risk 
factors to allow early detection, and early data may support this approach. The 
purpose of this article is to explore the potential utility of targeted breast 
cancer screening in men by examining unique clinical and biologic 
characteristics of male breast cancers that may lend themselves to mammographic 
detection. We will also discuss available evidence in screening outcomes in men 
and summarize recent updates in risk management recommendations in Society 
guidelines.

Early detection of breast cancer (BC) comprises two approaches: screening of 
asymptomatic women in a specified target population at risk (usually a target 
age range for women at average risk), and early diagnosis for women with BC 
signs and symptoms. Screening for BC is a key health intervention for early 
detection. While population-based screening programs have been implemented for 
age-selected women, the pivotal clinical trials have not addressed the global 
utility nor the improvement of screening performance by utilizing more refined 
parameters for patient eligibility, such as individualized risk stratification. 
In addition, with the exception of the subset of women known to carry germline 
pathogenetic mutations in (high- or moderately-penetrant) cancer predisposition 
genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, there has been less success in outreach and 
service provision for the unaffected relatives of women found to carry a 
high-risk mutation (i.e., ""cascade testing"") as it is in these individuals for 
whom such actionable information can result in cancers (and/or cancer deaths) 
being averted. Moreover, even in the absence of clinical cancer genetics 
services, as is the case for the immediate and at least near-term in most 
countries globally, the capacity to stratify the risk of an individual to 
develop BC has existed for many years, is available for free online at various 
sites/platforms, and is increasingly being validated for non-Caucasian 
populations. Ultimately, a precision approach to BC screening is largely 
missing. In the present chapter, we aim to address the concept of risk-adapted 
screening of BC, in multiple facets, and understand if there is a value in the 
implementation of adapted screening strategies in selected women, outside the 
established screening prescriptions, in the terms of age-range, screening 
modality and schedules of imaging.

Breast imaging. State-of-the-art.

Gold RH, Bassett LW, Kimme-Smith C.

The underlying goal of all breast imaging procedures is the detection of cancer. 
X-ray mammography places greatest emphasis on the disclosure of early, 
nonpalpable, curable cancer. Diagnostic ultrasonography stresses the 
differentiation of benign cysts from diagnostically indeterminate solid masses 
that require biopsy. Evolving experimental procedures such as transillumination 
light-scanning and magnetic resonance imaging currently are undergoing 
preliminary evaluation. An older procedure, thermography, seems to operate at a 
high level of effectiveness only for advanced cancer. Since x-ray mammography is 
the technique that has proven most successful in detecting early breast cancer, 
it is the standard to which all imaging alternatives must be compared.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting > 1.6 
million women each year, projected to increase to 2.2 million cases annually by 
2025. A disproportionate number of the > 500,000 women who die as a result of 
breast cancer each year reside in low-resource settings. Breast cancer control 
is an important component of cancer control planning and women's health 
programs, and tools are needed across the care continuum to reduce the cancer 
burden, especially in low-resource settings. Cancer control planning is complex 
and multifaceted. Evidence shows that outcomes are improved when prevention, 
early diagnosis, treatment, and palliation are integrated and synchronously 
developed within a country/region's health plan. The Knowledge Summaries for 
Comprehensive Breast Cancer Control are the product of a multiyear collaboration 
led by the Union for International Cancer Control, Breast Health Global 
Initiative, Pan American Health Organization, and Center for Global Health of 
the US National Cancer Institute. Fourteen knowledge summaries distilled from 
evidence-based, resource-stratified guidelines, and aligned with WHO guidance on 
breast cancer control, build a framework for resource prioritization pathways 
and delivery systems for breast cancer control at four levels of available 
resources: basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal. Each summary contains relevant 
content to inform breast cancer policy, clinical care, and advocacy, aiding in 
the development and implementation of policies and programs. These tools provide 
a common platform for stakeholders, including policymakers, administrators, 
clinicians, and advocates to engage in decision making appropriate to their 
local setting. The goal is to facilitate evidence-based policy actions and 
urgently advance implementation of an integrated approach to reduce breast 
cancer mortality and improve quality of life.

Unmet challenges in systemic therapy for early stage breast cancer.

Burstein HJ(1).

School, Boston, MA, USA. Electronic address: hal_burstein@dfci.harvard.edu.

Despite marked progress in outcomes for women with early stage breast cancer, 
unmet challenges persist. These include accounting for the cohort of tumors that 
do not have favorable clinical outcomes related to tumor heterogeneity, 
particularly the variation within the subset of ER positive breast cancer; 
better treatments for subsets where existing therapies are not fully effective; 
and the development of biomarkers to predict response or need for ongoing 
treatment. Beyond these tumor-related factors, there is persistent need for 
focus on improving the patient's experience of treatment - avoiding unnecessary 
therapy, and providing better supportive care so as to minimize side effects and 
social and economic disruption caused by treatment. For clinical investigators, 
the improved prognosis for early stage breast cancer has meant that large sample 
sizes of subjects are needed for prospective clinical trials with cancer outcome 
endpoints. As a consequence, the scale of clinical research enterprises has 
become enormous, too often unsupportable without industry or government 
resources. Finally, as breast cancer is a global health concern, there is an 
urgent need to assure that screening and treatment are available to women around 
the world so that the progress achieved in developed countries can reach 
billions of women everywhere on earth.

Omitting surgery for early breast cancer showing clinical complete response to 
primary systemic therapy.

Breast cancer is highly sensitive to systemic therapy. High probability of 
pathological complete response suggests a clinical question that omitting 
surgery is an effective alternative to surgery in breast cancer showing clinical 
complete response to primary systemic therapy. However, the validity of omitting 
surgery for early breast cancer after primary systemic therapy has not been 
sufficiently established; thus, even if pathological complete response is 
expected in patients showing clinical complete response, excision of the primary 
tumor site remains the standard treatment of breast cancer. Inappropriate 
omitting surgery increases the incidence of local recurrence, which can be the 
risk of a subsequent distant metastasis and reduced overall survival. To achieve 
acceptable local control rate, omitting surgery should be investigated in 
patients with early breast cancer where a high percentage of pathological 
complete response, a high concordance rate between clinical complete response 
and pathological complete response and an acceptable local control rate are 
expected. This review presents concept and ongoing clinical trials for omitting 
surgery for patients with breast cancer showing clinical complete response to 
primary systemic therapy.

Breast cancer is one of the familiar diseases in women. Incidence and mortality 
due to cancer, particularly breast cancer has been increasing for last 50 years, 
even though there is a lacuna in the diagnosis of breast cancer at early stages. 
According to World Health Organization (WHO) 2012 reports, breast cancer is the 
leading cause of death in women, accounting 23% of all cancer deaths. In Asia, 
one in every three women faces the risk of breast cancer in their lifetime as 
per reports of WHO 2012. Here, the review is been focused on different breast 
cancer markers, that is, tissue markers (hormone receptors, human epidermal 
growth factor-2, urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator 
inhibitor, p53 and cathepsin D), genetic markers (BRAC1 and 2 and gene 
expression microarray technique, etc.), and serum markers (CA 15.3, BR 27.29, 
MCA, CA 549, carcinoembryonic antigen, oncoproteins, and cytokeratins) used in 
present diagnosis, but none of the mentioned markers can diagnose breast cancer 
at an early stage. There is a disquieting need for the identification of best 
diagnosing marker, which can be able to diagnose even in early stage of breast 
carcinogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: The discovery of breast cancer at earlier stages with screening 
brings the risk that some cancers will be overdiagnosed or overtreated. 
Reasonable estimates show the overdiagnosis rate due to screening mammography to 
be low, 1-10%.
CONCLUSION: Overdiagnosis should not be used as a reason to delay the onset or 
decrease the frequency of screening, because neither strategy will decrease 
overdiagnosis. Improvements in personalized treatment will diminish the 
morbidity of treatment and, therefore, the significance of overdiagnosis.

Multiple social and financial barriers exist to breast cancer detection in 
Pakistan, which may cause a delay in seeking care and the final diagnosis. This 
analytical study documents the pathways and time courses associated with 
referral to diagnostic centres to evaluate the clinical signs and symptoms of 
breast cancer. This report also verifies the association between 
socio-demographic and clinical indicators concerning the length of time spent 
before reaching diagnostic facilities. A purposive sample of 200 patients was 
selected from two tertiary care hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, for the 
interviews. Descriptive statistics (that is, percentages, frequencies, and 
measures of central tendencies) and a multiple linear regression model were used 
to achieve the study objectives. The descriptive model showed 31-128 days 
interval between a patient's awareness of a clinical sign or symptom and 
receiving care. The healthcare system, including traditional healers, took from 
7 to 194 days, and the time to diagnosis ranged from 15 to 30 days. Pain 
severity, larger tumour size, lack of clinical improvement, and the desire to 
obtain better treatment were reasons given for seeking care, but lack of 
awareness and fear of financial burden related to accessing healthcare 
facilities were identified as barriers. Moreover, socio-demographic and other 
predictive clinical factors were potentially associated with and substantially 
influenced the likelihood of the increased length of breast cancer patients' 
time to reach diagnostic centres. In conclusion, referrals by multiple 
healthcare providers, especially traditional healers and general practitioners, 
was a significant predictor for delay in diagnosis. Therefore, increased 
awareness and a responsive healthcare system may reduce the time from the 
recognition of symptoms to the early detection of breast cancer among women, 
thus improving outcomes in a developing country.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly utilized, 
especially in screening for high-risk cases, because of its high sensitivity and 
superior ability to detect cancers as compared with mammography and ultrasound. 
Several limitations such as higher cost, longer examination time, longer 
interpretation time, and low availability have hindered the wider application of 
MRI, especially for screening of average-risk women. To overcome some of these 
limitations and increase access to MRI screening, an abbreviated breast MRI 
protocol has been introduced. Abbreviated breast MRI is becoming popular and 
challenges the status quo. This review aims to present an overview of 
abbreviated MRI, discuss the current findings, and introduce ongoing prospective 
trials.

Breast cancer has become one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in 
low- and middle-income countries, where 62% of the world's total new cases are 
diagnosed. Therefore, the productivity loss because of premature death resulting 
from female breast cancer is also on the rise. The major challenge in low- and 
middle-income countries is to reduce the proportion of women presenting with 
advanced-stage disease, a challenge unlikely to be overcome by adoption of 
expensive national mammography screening programs. Awareness and education 
campaigns should focus not only on patients and societies but also on policy 
makers to address and optimize breast cancer care. Adaptation of existing 
guidelines and prioritization according to local resources are essential to 
address the unique needs and overcome the unique barriers of each society to 
facilitate practical implementation and improve outcomes. Emphasis on the 
principle of a cancer groundshot in addressing value in cancer care is vital to 
improving access to therapies that are proven to work rather than chasing after 
new drugs or innovations of doubtful or marginal clinical benefit. Until we have 
drug-pricing interventions that take into account the local income of each 
society, we must acknowledge the fact that the delivery of cancer care will 
never be the same all around the world.

A high proportion of patients with breast cancer in the Philippines present at 
an advanced stage and have a rapid, unfavorable outcome. Providing breast cancer 
education and early detection to this population is important to help reduce 
this health disparity. This article describes the impact of a train-the-trainer

Breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and significantly 
decreases the sensitivity of mammography. Assessing a woman's risk of developing 
breast cancer is becoming increasingly important for establishing individual 
screening recommendations and preventive strategies. This article reviews the 
factors influencing mammographic density (MD), the available methods of MD 
assessment, and its effect on breast cancer. Finally, we discuss the 
supplemental screening methods for women with dense breast tissue.

OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to assess women's willingness to receive advice 
about cervical and bowel cancer screening participation and advice on cancer 
symptom awareness when attending breast cancer screening.
METHODS: Women (n = 322) aged 60-64 years, living in the United Kingdom, who had 
previously taken part in breast cancer screening were recruited via a market 
research panel. They completed an online survey assessing willingness to receive 
advice, the potential impact of advice on breast screening participation, 
prospective acceptability and preferences for mode and timing of advice.
RESULTS: Most women would be willing to receive information about cervical (86%) 
and bowel cancer screening (90%) and early symptoms of other cancers (92%) at a 
breast cancer screening appointment. Those who were not up to date with cervical 
cancer screening were less willing. Prospective acceptability was high for all 
three forms of advice and was associated with willingness to receive advice. 
Women would prefer to receive advice through a leaflet (41%) or discussion with 
the mammographer (30%) either before the appointment (27%), at the appointment 
(44%) or with their results (22%).
CONCLUSIONS: While there is high willingness and high acceptability towards 
using breast cancer screening as a teachable moment for advice about prevention 
and early detection of other cancers, some women find it unacceptable and this 
may reduce their likelihood of attending a breast screening appointment.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study focused on gaining women's insights 
into potential future initiatives to encourage screening and early diagnosis of 
cancer. Members of the public were also involved in piloting the questionnaire.

Personalized medicine is emerging as an important guiding principle in diagnosis 
and treatment. This means not just doing more for some, but safely doing less 
for others. The lessons learned about the biology of breast cancer over the last 
2 decades have enabled us to understand the incredible heterogeneity of breast 
cancer and its associated behavior. Although much work remains, there is an 
emerging opportunity to identify and recognize more indolent forms of breast 
cancer, made more prevalent through the widespread adoption of screening. With 
our improving systemic therapies and improved molecular tools, we now have the 
opportunity to reduce the burden of treatment in women with lower-risk tumors. 
Our surgical treatments have evolved, with less morbid and more cosmetic 
procedures. In this article, we review the indications for further reducing 
local therapy, including adjuvant radiation.

This article reviews the relevant data on breast magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) use in screening, the short-term surgical outcomes and long-term cancer 
outcomes associated with the use of MRI in breast cancer staging, the use of MRI 
in occult primary breast cancer, as well as MRI to assess eligibility for 
accelerated partial breast irradiation and to evaluate tumor response after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MRI for screening is supported in specific high-risk 
populations, namely, women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, a family history 
suggesting a hereditary breast cancer syndrome, or a history of chest wall 
radiation.

BACKGROUND: Lack of knowledge, poor awareness, and attitude are barriers to 
breast cancer (BC) screening participation. The ubiquitous usage of mobile 
phones makes it a perfect platform for delivering interventions to increase 
knowledge and awareness in screening, a strategy for early identification of BC. 
However, although numerous applications for BC prevention are available on major 
mobile phone platforms, relatively few have been tested in scientific studies to 
determine their efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of BrAware Apps in increasing 
the knowledge of BC risk factors, awareness of warning signs and confidence in 
breast self-examination (BSE) among women in northeast peninsular Malaysia.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre and post-test research design were conducted 
with 41 women participants in Kelantan, Malaysia, before and after using the 
BrAware apps. Participants were given an online, adapted Breast Cancer Awareness 
Measure questionnaire. Post-test was 2 months after using the BrAware apps. 
Comparison using paired T-tests were conducted to evaluate the change in 
knowledge of risk factors, warning signs awareness and confidence level for BSE.
RESULTS: The mean age of women was 39.71(SD = 8.80). The participants' mean 
knowledge score of BC warning signs differs before using BrAware (mean 70.62, SD 
11.74) and after using the BrAware app (mean 79.83, SD 10.15) at the <0.001 
level of significance.
CONCLUSIONS: The BrAware mobile app had a positive effect in increasing the 
women's knowledge of risk factors of BC, warning signs awareness and confidence 
level for BSE. It can be concluded that the mobile app may be an adjunct in 
educating women on BC.

Nurses play an important role in educating patients on breast cancer and have a 
positive influence in encouraging women to participate in breast screening. This 
current study aimed to use a train-the-trainer model to improve the level of 
knowledge of nurses on breast cancer and screening in Ras Al Khaimah, United 
Arab Emirates. The study also focused on the nurses' ability to train other 
nurses in assisting women to engage in breast screening. This interventional 
study used a mixed-method design. Seventeen female nurses (aged 28-60 years) 
were recruited from public and private health centers and participated in a 
breast cancer train-the-trainer workshop. They completed a survey before and 
after the workshop. The surveys included a series of open and closed questions 
to assess their knowledge of breast cancer symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, 
and patient communication. The study found that nurse participants had good 
baseline knowledge of breast cancer topics, including breast self-examinations, 
clinical breast examinations, and mammography. Responses were deemed accurate if 
they answered open-ended questions without incorrect information and correct 
options were selected in the quantitative sections. However, training improved 
the detail and accuracy of the participant responses. Training also improved the 
confidence of nurse participants to teach other women and nurses how to perform 
breast self-examinations and provide breast cancer information. There were 
significant increases in nurse participants' knowledge of risk factors 
(p < 0.001, r = 0.6) and symptoms (p = 0.003, r = 0.5). The nurse participants 
perceived that health education was the best means of encouraging women to 
participate in breast screening.

Breast cancer: basics, screening, diagnostics and treatment.

[Article in English, German]

Wörmann B.

Breast cancer is by far the most common malignancy in women. The median age is 
64 years. Stage at diagnosis and biological features determine the prognosis. 
Patients with early breast cancer, with locally advanced disease and with 
locoregional relapse can be cured. Modern treatment is multimodal. It includes 
surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are 
treated with palliative intent. Aims are alleviation of symptoms and 
prolongation of survival. Breast cancer specific mortality has continually 
decreased in the past 10 years. Five year survival rate is 87% in Germany. 
Patients with early breast cancer have an even higher chance of cure.

The breast cancer diagnosed in the women at or above age 70 is defined as breast 
cancer in the elderly.As the population keeps aging,breast cancer in the elderly 
presents increasing incidence and high mortality.Early detection,early 
diagnosis,and early treatment might improve the prognosis of these patients. 
Comprehensively evaluating the functional age of elderly patients is essential 
for the individualized treatment. Medical imaging plays a key role in the 
screening,early diagnosis,therapy selection,evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy 
efficacy,and postoperative follow-up.We reviewed the current literature and 
focused on the role of medical imaging in the diagnosis and treatment 
recommendations for breast cancer in the elderly.

Mammography is the only method of breast cancer screening that has established 
evidence of a mortality reduction. However, mammography does not achieve 
sufficient accuracy in the high-density breasts of patients<50 years of age. In 
2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force revised its recommendation for 
breast cancer screening in women aged 40-49 years from Grade B to C because the 
net benefit was relatively small for this age bracket. The net benefit of 
screening is the sum of benefits and harm and should always be monitored 
especially in population screening. A high recall rate, an inefficient number 
needed to invite for screening to prevent one breast cancer death, a high 
false-positive rate and unnecessary additional imaging for women aged 40-49 
years are great concerns of mammography screening. Overdiagnosis is also a 
detriment of mammography screening; however, it may have a limited effect on 
women aged 40-49 years. Establishment of new evidence for breast cancer 
screening, such as ultrasonography screening, is needed in order to create a 
more effective screening system.

BACKGROUND: Delays in diagnosis and treatment from first noticeable breast 
cancer symptoms are associated with poor outcomes. Understanding the reasons and 
barriers for patients' delay in seeking medical care is critical to mitigating 
the problem.
METHODS: In-person surveys were conducted among 462 women, aged 18-79, with 
incident breast cancer cases, recruited from two cancer hospitals in North 
Vietnam. Delay, defined as the time interval between symptom recognition to the 
diagnosis and initiation of treatment equal to or exceeding 3 months, was 
categorized as follows: no delay (<3 months), moderate delay (3-8 months), and 
serious delay (≥9 months). Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was 
applied in data analyses.
RESULTS: Over one-quarter patients (31.5%) experienced moderate delays, and 
close to one-fifth (17.5%) experienced serious delays. Adjusted odds ratios and 
95% confidence intervals for moderate and serious delays were 5.60 (3.00-10.47) 
and 4.25 (2.05-8.85) for financial and physical barriers, respectively. Moderate 
delay was positively associated with psychological barriers (5.55 [1.75-17.57]) 
and lack of proper knowledge (3.15 [1.47-6.74]). The associations of barriers 
with delays in diagnosis and treatment appeared stronger among women living in 
rural areas. A lack of proper knowledge was significantly associated with delay 
among young women (<45 years old) and those with high incomes, while 
psychological barriers were significantly associated with delay among older 
women (≥45 years old).
CONCLUSION: Delays in diagnosis and treatment are common among Vietnamese breast 
cancer patients and are affected by several noted barriers. Proper policy needs 
to be developed to address this public health issue.

The words, ""you have breast cancer,"" is possibly one of the most devastating 
statements an individual could image hearing from his or her physician even 
though breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. The diagnosis bears 
a significant amount of anxiety and fear in regards to treatment and overall 
survival. However, research has increased healthcare professionals' knowledge on 
the benefits of early screening, diagnosis, and treatments, which has steadily 
reduced the death rate from breast cancer over the past 20 years. Physicians are 
better able to predict how particular breast cancers will react to treatment; 
therefore, they are able to choose more effective treatment options based on 
these findings. The goal of this article is to highlight the incidence, staging 
and diagnostic studies, types, treatments, and follow-up of breast cancer 
dispelling some of the common societal stigmas and unfounded fears surrounding 
this diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Mammography screening can lead to overdiagnosis-that is, 
screen-detected breast cancer that would not have caused symptoms or signs in 
the remaining lifetime. There is no consensus about the frequency of breast 
cancer overdiagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rate of breast cancer overdiagnosis in contemporary 
mammography practice accounting for the detection of nonprogressive cancer.
DESIGN: Bayesian inference of the natural history of breast cancer using 
individual screening and diagnosis records, allowing for nonprogressive 
preclinical cancer. Combination of fitted natural history model with life-table 
data to predict the rate of overdiagnosis among screen-detected cancer under 
biennial screening.
SETTING: Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) facilities.
PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50 to 74 years at first mammography screen between 2000 
and 2018.
MEASUREMENTS: Screening mammograms and screen-detected or interval breast 
cancer.
RESULTS: The cohort included 35 986 women, 82 677 mammograms, and 718 breast 
cancer diagnoses. Among all preclinical cancer cases, 4.5% (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI], 0.1% to 14.8%) were estimated to be nonprogressive. In a program 
of biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years, 15.4% (UI, 9.4% to 26.5%) of 
screen-detected cancer cases were estimated to be overdiagnosed, with 6.1% (UI, 
0.2% to 20.1%) due to detecting indolent preclinical cancer and 9.3% (UI, 5.5% 
to 13.5%) due to detecting progressive preclinical cancer in women who would 
have died of an unrelated cause before clinical diagnosis.
LIMITATIONS: Exclusion of women with first mammography screen outside BCSC.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of an authoritative U.S. population data set, the 
analysis projected that among biennially screened women aged 50 to 74 years, 
about 1 in 7 cases of screen-detected cancer is overdiagnosed. This information 
clarifies the risk for breast cancer overdiagnosis in contemporary screening 
practice and should facilitate shared and informed decision making about 
mammography screening.
