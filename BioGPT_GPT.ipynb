It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions (\"virtual endarterectomy\"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque.', 'We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 ± 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 ± 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation.', 'Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 ± 0.09.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine.', 'We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice.', 'We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide.'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloroquine', 'Concanavalin A', 'Cyclosporine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Interleukin-2', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lysosomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Spleen', 'T-Lymphocytes'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}\n",

Mortality compared with historic controls.', 'Despite a relatively large sample size, the ability of the Young-Burgess system to predict mortality only approached statistical significance (P = 0.07, Kruskal-Wallis). The Young-Burgess system differentiated transfusion requirements--lateral compression Type 3 (LC3) and anteroposterior compression Types 2 (APC2) and 3 (APC3) fractures had higher transfusion requirements than did lateral compression Type 1 (LC1), anteroposterior compression Type 1 (APC1), and vertical shear (VS) (P<0.05)--but was not as useful at predicting head, chest, or abdomen injuries. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allowed the system to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine.', 'We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice.', 'We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma.
