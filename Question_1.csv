Abstract
"Osimertinib is used as the first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Nevertheless, its efficacy and safety in clinical practice remain to be fully elucidated and the pattern of progression and the optimal subsequent treatment after osimertinib remains unclear. This was a multicenter prospective observational study. EGFR mutation-positive patients with NSCLC who started first-line osimertinib from September 2018 to August 2020 were enrolled and followed up until August 2022. A total of 583 patients received osimertinib. The median progression-free and overall survival were 20.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.6-21.7) months and 41.0 (95% CI: 37.1-44.1) months, respectively. Grade 3 or worse adverse events were observed in 136 patients (23.3%). Progression patterns were categorized as central nervous system only, oligo-progression, and multiple organs on the basis of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-progressive disease and occurred in 37 (10.8%), 156 (45.4%), and 151 patients (43.9%). The patient's condition on progression was asymptomatic in 195 patients (56.7%). Osimertinib was continued in 163 patients (47.4%) after confirming progression. In clinically stable population with progressive disease (n = 247), survival after progression was 13.3 (95% CI: 10.9-16.4) months for those who continued osimertinib beyond progressive disease (n = 124), and 24.1 (95% CI: 17.7-34.0) months for those who discontinued osimertinib (n = 123) (hazard ratio = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.38-2.91,  p First-line osimertinib was found to have good effectiveness comparable to that reported in pivotal studies. Nevertheless, osimertinib should be discontinued among those who develop progression. UMIN000038683. © 2024 The Authors."
"We wanted to present a rare case of metastatic grade 2 spinal ependymoma with an atypical course at the time of diagnosis. Temozolomide plus capecitabine chemotherapy was started in May 2018 on a 30-year-old female patient with sacral ependymoma who had extensive lung metastases at the time of diagnosis. The patient remained in remission for approximately 29 months, and the current chemotherapy was continued until it progressed in November 2020. According to this case report, a combination of temozolomide and capecitabine may be the best treatment option for ependymoma patients.

"Chemotherapy in an integral part of cancer treatment, either administered alone or in combination with radiation. However, the cost of these drugs is often prohibitively high for most patients. To address this issue, the Government of India has established Jan Aushadhi (JAS) stores across the country, where affordable generic medicines are available. In the current study, we performed a cost minimization analysis comparing JAS drugs with branded chemotherapeutic drugs used in various cancer treatment regimens. This study was to conduct a cost-minimization analysis by comparing the costs of different regimens when using JAS drugs, the most expensive branded drugs, and the least expensive branded drugs in the treatment of cancer in India. The study focused on conducting a cost minimization analysis of various chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of different cancers, considering the availability of anticancer drugs at JAS stores. The costs for different chemotherapy regimens, including both anticancer and supportive drugs, were calculated for single and complete cycles. The costs of the most expensive and least expensive branded drugs were noted from the Current Index of Medical Stores. The cost difference (CD) was calculated by subtracting the cost of the cheaper drug from that of the costliest brand. The cost ratio (CR) and the percentage of cost variation (PCV) were calculated for India-specific conditions. The study analyzed the CD for various regimens using JAS drugs for chemotherapy treatment of breast, esophagus, rectal, colon, stomach, prostate, ovary, endometrial, cervical, head and neck, lung, multiple myeloma, testicular, and lymphoma cancers. It also considered chemoirradiation regimens for brain, head and neck, anorectal, esophageal, and uterine cervical cancers. Significant CDs were observed when both anticancer and supportive drugs were obtained from JAS stores. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to consider the CD, CR, and PCV for various regimens using JAS drugs, as well as the costliest and cheapest branded drugs in standard cancer treatment regimens. The results of this study are expected to assist healthcare professionals and pharmacists in understanding the cost-saving benefits of substituting expensive branded drugs with more affordable chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer. This substitution can provide financial benefit for socioeconomically marginalized population. Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics."
"DNA methylation plays a regulatory role in the oncogenesis and tumor progression and is valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. While circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is widely used in the detection of oncogenic mutations and the guidance of treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), studies of ctDNA methylation remains insufficient. We aim to investigate the methylation profiles of ctDNA in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy and to discover novel biomarkers with predictive or prognostic value. We recruited 49 patients with  EGFR Genomic mutation profiling revealed no significant association of PFS or best overall response (BOR) and ctDNA status. Evaluation of ctDNA methylation showed a negative correlation between the methylation of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes and PFS (R=-0.31,  P SNORD3F P Our study explored the prognostic value of ctDNA methylation in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing targeted therapies and first revealed the predictive role of  SNORD3F © 2024 Liu et al."
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, ranking first in men and second in women. Due to its aggressive nature, early detection and accurate localization of tumors are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aims to apply advanced deep learning techniques to identify lung cancer in its early stages using CT scan images. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including MobileNetV2, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, VGG-19, and InceptionV3, were used for lung cancer detection. Once the disease was identified, the tumor's region was segmented using models such as UNet, SegNet, and InceptionUNet. The InceptionResNetV2 model achieved the highest detection accuracy of 98.5%, while UNet produced the best segmentation results, with a Jaccard index of 95.3%. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models, particularly InceptionResNetV2 and UNet, in both detecting and segmenting lung cancer, showing significant potential for aiding early diagnosis and treatment. Future work could focus on refining these models and exploring their application in other medical domains."
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that remains a major diagnostic challenge due to the variety of its clinical presentations. This case highlights the importance of early biopsy of oral lesions without tendency to heal to attain the diagnosis more quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on both oral and pulmonary involvements in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The presented case describes an Iranian 18-year-old girl with chronic cough and dyspnea referred for evaluation of the upper jaw due to bone exposure, bone loss, and soft tissue ulceration. Her medical history revealed mediastinal mass, cavitary lesion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, cytologic and immunohistochemical analysis did not show any evidence of malignancy. In this case a lymphoproliferative disease was suspected but ultimately the oral biopsy diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chemotherapy could be started. Systemic conditions should be considered as a possible cause of oral lesions and a biopsy should also be performed immediately if there is any doubt concerning the nature of the lesion. Moreover, some conditions necessitate multiple biopsies to attain an accurate diagnosis. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWS). By scanning PubMed, Web of science, Embase, and other relevant clinical information public databases, nine RCTs and eight RWSs involving 5205 patients were included in the study. We directly compared the differences between chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy, and determined the optimal treatment strategy through network meta-analysis (NMA). Compared to chemotherapy, the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improves the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) in SCLC patients. Regarding safety, both RCTs and RWSs indicated no significant difference in grade 3-4 adverse events between chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy. NMA showed serplulimab plus chemotherapy (Serp_Chemo) appears to provide the best OS, PFS, and ORR benefit, while nivolumab plus chemotherapy shows higher toxicity than other regimens. In subgroup analysis, for elderly patients (age ≥65) and non-elderly (age <65) patients, the most promising quality regimens for achieving better OS extension are atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (Atez_Chemo) and Serp_Chemo, respectively. For patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > upper limit of normal (ULN), there is no apparent OS benefit from immune therapy. In ES-SCLC treatment, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to standard chemotherapy improves OS, PFS, and ORR, with Serp_Chemo shows the most promise. Atez_Chemo and Serp_Chemo provided better survival for elderly and non-elderly patients, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s). Thoracic Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."
"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently occurring cancer disease observed in women after lung cancer. Out of different stages, invasive ductal BC causes maximum deaths in women. In this work, three deep learning (DL) models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Convmixer, and Visual Geometry Group-19 (VGG-19) are implemented for the detection and classification of different breast cancer tumors with the help of Breast cancer histopathological (Break His) image database. The performance of each model is evaluated using an 80:20 training scheme and measured in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, loss, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). From the simulation result, ViT showed the best performance for binary classification of breast cancer tumors with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 99.89 %, 98.29 %, 98.29 %, and 98.29 %, respectively. Also, ViT showed the best performance in terms of accuracy (98.21 %), average Precision (89.84 %), recall (89.97 %), and F1-score (88.75) for eight class classifications. Moreover, we have also ensemble the ViT-Convmixer model and observed that the performance of the ensemble model is reduced as compared to the ViT model. We have also compared the performance of the proposed best model with other existing models reported by several research groups. The study will help find suitable models that will increase accuracy in early diagnoses of BC. We hope the study will also help to minimize human errors in the early diagnosis of this fatal disease and administer appropriate treatment. The proposed model may also be implemented for the detection of other diseases with improved accuracy. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Breast cancer has the potential to metastasize to various sites; however, cases of metastasis to the cervix are rare. Here, we present clinical and pathological data from a rare case of primary breast cancer metastasis to the cervix, including imaging characteristics and clinical progression. A 68-year-old female patient self-detected nodules in her right breast. B-ultrasound examination revealed multiple nodules in the right breast, classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4c. Radical treatment for right breast cancer was commenced. Histopathologic diagnosis revealed invasive ductal breast carcinoma of no specific type, with intraductal carcinoma in the right breast. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the tumor was androgen receptor (AR)-diffuse strong positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, with human epidermal receptor-2 (HER2, c-erbB-2) overexpression, and Ki-67 proliferation index 60%. The tumor was positive for GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed  HER2 HER2 HER2 HER2 We report a relatively rare case of primary breast cancer metastasis to three metastatic sites: cervix, lung, and neck.

"Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a high-risk manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease. In this prospective, multicenter phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03674047), adult participants with BOS were treated with ruxolitinib 10mg twice daily, continuously in 28-day cycles for up to 12 cycles. Participants enrolled into newly diagnosed (<6 months since BOS diagnosis, cohort A) or established (≥6 months since BOS diagnosis, cohort B) disease cohorts, respectively. The primary objective was to evaluate the early treatment effect of ruxolitinib, assessed by the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 3 months compared to enrollment. The primary endpoint differed according to cohort (Cohort A: improvement, defined as ³10% increase in FEV1; Cohort B: stabilization, defined as absence of ³10% decrease in FEV1). Between 2019 and 2022, 49 participants meeting criteria for BOS were enrolled and treated (cohort A, n=36; cohort B, n=13). The primary endpoint was achieved by 27.8% of participants with new BOS and 92.3% of participants with established BOS. According to the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria, the best lung-specific overall response rate on ruxoltinib for the 49 participants was 34.7% (16.3% complete response, 18.4% partial response), with most responses occurring in mild or moderate disease. Non-infectious severe (grade ≥3) treatment-emergent adverse events were infrequent. Nine severe infectious events occurred and were largely respiratory in nature. These results support the use of ruxolitinib in the management of BOS after allogeneic HCT. Copyright © 2024 American Society of Hematology."
"For drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, there is a delicate balance between efficacy and toxicity, thus it is pivotal to administer the right dose from the first administration onwards. Exposure of pemetrexed, a cytotoxic drug used in lung cancer treatment, is dictated by kidney function. To facilitate optimized dosing of pemetrexed, accurate prediction of drug clearance is pivotal. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the performance of the kidney function biomarkers serum creatinine, cystatin C and pro-enkephalin in terms of predicting the elimination of pemetrexed. We performed a population pharmacokinetic analysis using a dataset from two clinical trials containing pharmacokinetic data of pemetrexed and measurements of all three biomarkers. A three-compartment model without covariates was fitted to the data and the obtained individual empirical Bayes estimates for pemetrexed clearance were considered the ""true"" values Cl true CR CYS CR-CYS The dataset consisted of 66 subjects with paired observations for all three kidney function biomarkers.

"The IROC head and neck phantom is used to credential institutions for IMRT delivery for all anatomical sites where delivery of modulated therapy is a primary challenge. This study evaluated how appropriate the use of this phantom is for varied clinical anatomy by evaluating how closely the IROC head and neck phantom described clinical dose errors from beam modeling compared to various anatomical sites. The MLC offset, transmission, PDD and seven additional beam modeling parameters for a Varian accelerator were modified in RayStation to match community data at the 2.5, 25, 50, 75 and 97.5 percentile levels. Modifications were evaluated on 25 H&N phantom cases and 25 clinical cases (H&N, prostate, lung, mesothelioma, and brain), generating 2,000 plan perturbations. Differences in mean dose delivered to clinical target volumes (CTV) and organs at risk (OAR) were compared between phantom and clinical plans to assess the relationship between dose deviations in phantom versus clinical CTVs, and as a function of 18 different complexity metrics. Perturbations to MLC offset and transmission parameters demonstrated the greatest impact on dose accuracy for phantom and clinical plans (for all anatomic sites). The phantom demonstrated equivalent or greater sensitivity to these parameter perturbations when compared to clinical sites, largely aligning with treatment complexity. The mean MLC Gap best described the impact of errors in TPS beam modeling parameters in phantoms plan and clinical plans from various anatomical sites. When compared across various anatomical sites, the IROC H&N credentialing phantom exhibited similar or greater sensitivity to errors in the treatment planning system. As such, it is a suitable surrogate device for assessing institutional performance across various anatomical sites. If an institution successfully irradiates the phantom, that result confers confidence that IMRT to a wide range of anatomical sites can be successfully delivered by the institution. Copyright © 2024.

"To compare the efficacy of first-line regimens based on programmed cell death (or ligand) [PD-(L)1] blockade in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients with or without liver metastases (LM), and to identify optimal treatment strategies. Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) and chemotherapy (CT) in ES-SCLC patients stratified by LM. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven RCTs involving 3658 ES-SCLC patients (1243 with LM, 2415 without LM) were analyzed. For patients with LM, the combination therapies of anti-PD-1 + CT (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54%-0.82%; p < 0.001) and anti-PD-L1 + CT + anti-angiogenesis (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71%-0.99%; p = 0.042) demonstrated superior efficacy in prolonging OS compared to CT alone. The anti-PD-1 + CT regimen had the highest cumulative probability of 91.6% for extending OS in patients with LM. For patients without LM, all CIT regimens resulted in improved OS compared to CT alone, with the regimen of anti-angiogenesis + anti-PD-L1 + CT ranking first and having the highest cumulative probability of 95.5% for prolonging OS. CIT is effective for ES-SCLC patients regardless of LM status. For patients with LM, PD-1 blockade combined with CT is the best option. For patients without LM, the most beneficial regimen is the combination of anti-angiogenesis, PD-L1 blockade, and CT. © 2024 The Author(s). Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluates first-line treatment options for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. We analyzed 24 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,682 patients, comparing various EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and combination therapies. Direct comparisons showed that the addition of bevacizumab or chemotherapy to first-generation (1G) EGFR-TKIs improved overall survival (OS) compared to 1G TKIs alone, with HRs of 0.704 (95% CI: 0.433-0.973) and 0.682 (95% CI: 0.464-0.899), respectively. However, third-generation (3G) TKI monotherapy did not significantly improve OS compared with 1G TKIs, with an HR of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.511-1.198). Indirect comparisons suggested that the combination of 3G TKIs with chemotherapy provided the most significant improvements in OS and progression-free survival (PFS), significantly outperforming 3G TKIs, with HRs of OS 1.69 (95% CI: 1.14-3.4) and PFS 2.13 (95% CI: 1.28-3.54). Intracranial PFS was best with 1G TKIs plus bevacizumab. Our findings suggest that 3G EGFR-TKIs in combination with chemotherapy may be the most effective strategy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and brain metastases, though further head-to-head trials are needed for validation. © 2024.

"Accurate staging improves lung cancer survival by increasing the chances of delivering stage-appropriate therapy. However, there is underutilization of, and variability in, the use of guideline-recommended diagnostic tests used to stage lung cancer. Consequently, the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT) convened the Triage for Appropriate Treatment Task Group-a multidisciplinary expert and stakeholder panel-to identify knowledge and/or resource gaps contributing to guideline-discordant staging and make recommendations to overcome these gaps. The task group determined the following: Gap 1: facilitators of and barriers to guideline-concordant staging are incompletely understood; Recommendation 1: identify facilitators of and barriers to guideline-concordant lung cancer staging; Gap 2: the level of evidence supporting staging algorithms is low-to-moderate; Recommendation 2: prioritize comparative-effectiveness studies evaluating lung cancer staging; Gap 3: guideline recommendations vary across professional societies; Recommendation 3: harmonize guideline recommendations across professional societies; Gap 4: existing databases do not contain sufficient information to measure guideline-concordant staging; Recommendation 4: augment existing databases with the information required to measure guideline-concordant staging; Gap 5: health systems do not have a performance feedback mechanism for lung cancer staging; Recommendation 5: develop and implement a performance feedback mechanism for lung cancer staging; Gap 6: patients rarely self-advocate for guideline-concordant staging; Recommendation 6: increase opportunities for patient self-advocacy for guideline-concordant staging; and Gap 7: current health policies do not motivate guideline-concordant lung cancer staging; Recommendation 7: organize a representative working group under the ACS NLCRT that promotes policies that motivate guideline-concordant lung cancer staging. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Staging-determining the degree of cancer spread-is important because it helps clinicians choose the best cancer treatment. Receiving the best cancer treatment leads to the best possible patient outcomes. Practice guidelines are intended to help clinicians stage patients with lung cancer. However, lung cancer staging in the United States often varies from practice guideline recommendations.

"This research aimed to systematically uncover the metastatic characteristics and survival rates of lung cancer subtypes and to evaluate the impact of surgery at the primary tumor site on cancer-specific survival in DM lung cancer. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2019) to identify primary lung cancers with DM at presentation (M1). Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were generated and compared utilizing log-rank tests. Cox regression methods were employed to determine hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals related to CSS factors. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to reduce bias. We analyzed 77,827 M1 lung cancer cases, with 41.22% having DM at presentation. Bone metastasis was most common in ADC, ASC, SCC, LCC; brain in LCNEC; liver in SCLC. Lung was common in TC + AC and SCC. Long-term survival was best in TC + AC and worst in SCLC (p < 0.001). Male gender, age < 50, primary tumor site (main bronchus, lower lobe), large tumor diameter, ADC/SCLC/SCC pathology, and regional lymph node involvement were significant risk factors for multiorgan metastasis. Age ≥ 50, male, large tumor diameter, positive lymph nodes, and multiorgan metastases were associated with lower CSS. In contrast, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, systemic therapy, and surgery were associated with higher CSS rates. Primary tumor resection improved survival in lung cancer patients (excluding small cell lung cancer, SCLC) with single organ metastases (KM log rank p < 0.001, HR = 0.6165; 95% CI (0.5468-0.6951)), especially in brain (p < 0.001, HR = 0.6467; 95% CI (0.5505-0.7596)) and bone (p = 0.182, HR = 0.6289; p < 0.01), but not in liver or intrapulmonary metastases after IPTW. Significant differences in DM patterns and corresponding survival rates exist among lung cancer subtypes. Primary tumor resection improves survival in lung cancer patients (excluding small cell lung cancer, SCLC) with single organ metastases, with better outcomes in patients with brain and bone metastases, while no significant benefit was seen in patients with liver and intrapulmonary metastases. © 2024.

"Lymph node metastasis (LNM) plays a crucial role in the management of lung cancer; however, the ability of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging to detect LNM status is limited. This study aimed to develop and validate a vision transformer-based deep transfer learning nomogram for predicting LNM in lung adenocarcinoma patients using preoperative unenhanced chest CT imaging. This study included 528 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. The pretrained vision transformer (ViT) was utilized to extract deep transfer learning (DTL) feature, and logistic regression was employed to construct a ViT-based DTL model. Subsequently, the model was compared with six classical convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Finally, the ViT-based DTL signature was combined with independent clinical predictors to construct a ViT-based deep transfer learning nomogram (DTLN). The ViT-based DTL model showed good performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821 (95% CI, 0.775-0.867) in the training cohort and 0.825 (95% CI, 0.758-0.891) in the validation cohort. The ViT-based DTL model demonstrated comparable performance to classical CNN models in predicting LNM, and the ViT-based DTL signature was then used to construct ViT-based DTLN with independent clinical predictors such as tumor maximum diameter, location, and density. The DTLN achieved the best predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.865 (95% CI, 0.827-0.903) and 0.894 (95% CI, 0845-0942), respectively, surpassing both the clinical factor model and the ViT-based DTL model (p < 0.001). This study developed a new DTL model based on ViT to predict LNM status in lung adenocarcinoma patients and revealed that the performance of the ViT-based DTL model was comparable to that of classical CNN models, confirming that ViT was viable for deep learning tasks involving medical images. The ViT-based DTLN performed exceptionally well and can assist clinicians and radiologists in making accurate judgments and formulating appropriate treatment plans. © 2024 American Association of Physicists in Medicine."

"Durvalumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that has efficacy in many advanced-stage cancers, especially in small-cell lung cancer. The efficacy of durvalumab can be enhanced by chemotherapy. Cutaneous side effects due to treatment with durvalumab are usually self-limiting and easily manageable. We present a clinical case of a female patient aged 61, with small-cell lung carcinoma in stage III B, cT3N2M, who developed a disseminated cutaneous vasculitis after seven months of durvalumab monotherapy, having previously been treated with polychemotherapy according to oncological protocols. To the best of our knowledge, based on a comprehensive search in leading databases, like Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and some others, ours is the first published case of disseminated cutaneous vasculitis as a result of Durvalumab treatment. Anticancer immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has transformed the treatment and evolution of patients with multiple varieties of hematologic cancers. In this context, the cutaneous side effects due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies are very few in the scientific literature. Based on this need, we have performed a mini-review of cutaneous side effects due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies that treat actual aspects in this sense. We also present some artificial intelligence challenges and future perspectives in the combination of human reasoning and reasoning based on Artificial Intelligence for study of the very rare Disseminate cutaneous vasculitis associated with Durvalumab treatment."
"The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment paradigm of lung cancer, resulting in notable enhancements in patient survival. Nevertheless, evaluating treatment response in patients undergoing immunotherapy poses distinct challenges due to unconventional response patterns like pseudoprogressive disease (PPD), dissociated response (DR), and hyperprogressive disease (HPD). Conventional response criteria such as the RECIST 1.1 may not adequately address these complexities. To tackle this issue, novel response criteria such as the iRECIST and imRECIST have been proposed, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of treatment response by incorporating additional scans and considering the best overall response even after radiologic progressive disease evaluation. Additionally, [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging has emerged as a valuable modality for evaluating treatment response, with various metabolic response criteria such as the PERCIMT, imPERCIST, and iPERCIST developed to overcome the limitations of traditional criteria, particularly in detecting pseudoprogression. A multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, radiologists, and nuclear medicine specialists is crucial for effectively navigating these complexities and enhancing patient outcomes in the era of immunotherapy for lung cancer. In this review, we delineate the key components of these guidelines, summarizing essential aspects for radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Furthermore, we provide insights into how imaging can guide the management of individual lung cancer patients in real-world multidisciplinary settings."
"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly invasive and rapidly proliferating lung tumor subtype. Most patients respond well to a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors. Unfortunately, not all patients benefit from this treatment regimen, and few alternative therapies are available. In this scenario, the identification of new biomarkers and differential therapeutic strategies to improve tumor response becomes urgent. Here, we investigated the role of exosomes (EXs) released from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SCLC patients in mediating the functional crosstalk between the immune system and tumors in response to treatments. In this study, we showed that PBMC-EXs from SCLC patients with different responses to chemoimmunotherapy showed different levels of immune (STING and MAVS) and EMT (Snail and c-Myc) markers. We demonstrated that PBMC-EXs derived from best responder (BR) patients were able to induce a significant increase in apoptosis in SCLC cell lines in vitro compared to PBMC-EXs derived from non-responder (NR) SCLC patients. PBMC-EXs were able to affect cell viability and modulate apoptotic markers, DNA damage and the replication stress pathway, as well as the occurrence of EMT. Our work provides proof of concept that PBMC-EXs can be used as a tool to study the crosstalk between cancer cells and immune cells and that PBMC-EXs exhibit an in vitro ability to promote cancer cell death and reduce tumor aggressiveness."
"With the advent of targeted therapies, the survival prognosis for metastatic tumors has extended, and it has become necessary to diagnose and consider treatment that takes into account Quality of Life for metastatic tumors of the eye. The reports of checking tumor marker in the aqueous humor for diagnosis of metastatic intraocular tumors are few. Here, we report a case of masquerade syndrome with secondary glaucoma in which a high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in the aqueous humor could assist diagnosis, and continuing targeted therapy and trabeculectomy were effective. A 73-year-old man was referred to us for iritis and high intraocular pressure (IOP) with severe eye pain in the left eye. He had Stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma treated with a molecularly targeted drug, Osimertinib. His best corrected visual acuity was 0.15, and IOP was 52 mmHg in the left eye. Anterior chamber cells (+), numerous small nodules in the iris, and small masses in the inferior angle were observed. In the aqueous humor, the CEA level was higher than in the blood. Napsin A and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1) positive cells showed in the resected tissue at iridectomy performed during trabeculectomy. The pathological diagnosis of metastatic iris tumor of the lung adenocarcinoma was made, and we injected bevacizumab intravitreally once and continued Osimertinib. His IOP lowered to 8-10 mmHg, and the iris masses disappeared. He lost vision by metastasis to the left optic nerve after termination of Osimertinib one and a half years later. The metastasis shrank after restarting the drug. He passed away from an exacerbation of his primary lung cancer two years and nine months after the first visit. Although he lost vision in his left eye, the metastatic tumor in his left eye and optic nerve had disappeared, and his quality of life was maintained without any pain in his eye. Checking tumor markers in the aqueous humor can aid in diagnosis, and aggressive treatment of metastatic iris tumors must help maintain patients' Quality of Life. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"A dosimetric evaluation is still lacking in terms of clinical target volume (CTV) omission in stage III patients treated with 4D-CT Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). 49 stage III NSCLC patients received 4D-CT IMRT were reviewed. Target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were re-delineated. Four IMRT plans were conducted retrospectively to deliver different prescribed dose (74 Gy-60 Gy), and with or without CTV implementation. Dose and volume histogram (DVH) parameters were collected and compared. In the PTV-g 60 Gy plan (PTV-g refers to the PTV generated from the internal gross tumor volume), only 5 of 49 patients had the isodose ≥ 50 Gy line covering at least 95% of the PTV-c (PTV-c refers to the PTV generated from the internal CTV) volume. When the prescribed dose was elevated to 74 Gy to the PTV-g, 33 of 49 patients could have the isodose ≥ 50 Gy line covering at least 95% of the PTV-c volume. In terms of OARs protection, the SIB-IMRT plan showed the lowest value of V5, V20, and mean dose of lung, had the lowest V55 of esophagus, and the lowest estimated radiation doses to immune cells (EDIC). The V20, V30, and mean dose of heart was lower in the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT (SIB-IMRT) plan than that of the PTV-c 60 Gy plan. CTV omission was not suitable for stage III patients when the prescribed dose to PTV-g was 60 Gy in the era of 4D-CT IMRT. CTV omission plus high dose to PTV-g (74 Gy for example) warranted further exploration. The SIB-IMRT plan had the best protection to normal tissue including lymphocytes, and might be the optimal choice. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Nutritional status assessment has been deemed essential in treating elderly cancer patients. This study aims to investigate and compare the prognostic value and clinical utility of pre-treatment nutritional indicators in elderly rectal cancer (RC) patients. We retrospectively collected data from 361 elderly rectal cancer patients. The optimal cut-off values for pre-treatment nutritional indicators were calculated using ROC curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were conducted to identify independent prognostic nutritional indicators. The predictive performance and clinical utility of these independent nutritional indicators was evaluated using time-dependent ROC. Multivariate analyses showed that body mass index (BMI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI), and platelet-albumin ratio (PAR) independently predicted overall survival and progression-free survival in elderly RC patients (all p < 0.05), except for advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI). According to the nomogram model, the pre-treatment nutritional prognosis score was calculated and the patients were risk stratified. The KM curve showed that the survival of the high-risk group was significantly worse than that of the low-moderate risk group. Time-dependent ROC indicated that novel nutritional prognostic indicator (NNPI) had the best predictive ability compared with the independent prognostic nutritional indicator. Subgroup analysis also showed that NNPI had prognostic value across different clinical factors and had significant clinical utility. In elderly RC patients, BMI, PNI, GNRI, PAR, and NNPI serve as objective assessment tools for nutrition-related mortality risk. Identifying elderly patients at higher nutritional risk can guide early clinical nutritional interventions and improve patient outcomes. © 2024. The Author(s)."
"Ranked high in worldwide growing health issues, pleural diseases affect approximately one million people globally per year and are often correlated with a poor prognosis. Among these pleural diseases, malignant pleural mesothelioma (PM), a neoplastic disease mainly due to asbestos exposure, still remains a diagnostic challenge. Timely diagnosis is imperative to define the most suitable therapeutic approach for the patient, but the choice of diagnostic modalities depends on operator experience and local facilities while bearing in mind the yield of each diagnostic procedure. Since the analysis of pleural fluid cytology is not sufficient in differentiating historical features in PM, histopathological and morphological features obtained via tissue biopsies are fundamental. The quality of biopsy samples is crucial and often requires highly qualified expertise. Since adequate tissue biopsy is essential, medical or video-assisted thoracoscopy (MT or VATS) is proposed as the most suitable approach, with the former being a physician-led procedure. Indeed, MT is the diagnostic gold standard for malignant pleural pathologies. Moreover, this medical or surgical approach can allow diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: it provides the possibility of video-assisted biopsies, the drainage of high volumes of pleural fluid and the administration of sterile calibrated talcum powder under visual control in order to achieve pleurodesis, placement of indwelling pleural catheters if required and in a near future potential intrapleural therapy. In this context, dedicated diagnostic pathways remain a crucial need, especially to quickly and properly diagnose PM. Lastly, the interdisciplinary approach and multidisciplinary collaboration should always be implemented in order to direct the patient to the best customised diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. At the present time, the diagnosis of PM remains an unsolved problem despite MDT (multidisciplinary team) meetings, mainly because of the lack of standardised diagnostic work-up. This review aims to provide an overview of diagnostic procedures in order to propose a clear strategy."
"The optimal number of lymph nodes to be dissected during lung cancer surgery to minimise the postoperative recurrence risk remains undetermined. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of the number of dissected lymph nodes on the risk of postoperative recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses. We retrospectively analysed 650 patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection. Five machine learning models were trained using clinicopathological variables to predict postoperative recurrence. The relationship between the number of dissected lymph nodes and postoperative recurrence was investigated in the best-performing model using Shapley additive explanations values and partial dependence plots. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to estimate the HR for postoperative recurrence based on the number of dissected nodes. The random forest model demonstrated superior predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.92, accuracy: 0.83, F1 score: 0.64). The partial dependence plot of this model revealed a non-linear dependence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on recurrence prediction within the range of 0-20 nodes, with the weakest dependence at 10 nodes. A linear increase in the dependence was observed for ≥20 dissected nodes. A multivariable analysis revealed a significantly elevated risk of recurrence in the group with ≥20 dissected nodes in comparison to those with <20 nodes (adjusted HR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.003 to 2.087). The number of dissected lymph nodes was significantly associated with the risk of postoperative recurrence of NSCLC. The risk of recurrence is minimised when approximately 10 nodes are dissected but may increase when >20 nodes are removed. Limiting lymph node dissection to approximately 20 nodes may help to preserve a favourable antitumour immune environment. These findings provide novel insights into the optimisation of lymph node dissection during lung cancer surgery. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"Carinal reconstruction remains a technically challenging procedure for thoracic surgeons due to the complexity of airway resection and management. This is typically performed in the setting of tumour resection affecting the carina and distal trachea. Airway management of patients undergoing surgical resection of tumours involving the carina is highly challenging. This is due to an open, shared airway and the need for single-lung ventilation to facilitate surgery. Common modalities used for intraoperative ventilation include cross-table ventilation, veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiopulmonary bypass is usually avoided due to the requirement of full heparinization, which increases the demands of a technically challenging procedure, in addition to its contraindication in oncological resections. Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not readily available in most thoracic units. This leaves cross-table ventilation, which is commonly used for open thoracotomy and sternotomy cases, but has never been reported for minimally invasive procedures.  Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, cross-table ventilation has never been used for minimally invasive robotic carinal reconstruction. We present a step-by-step video tutorial in performing surgical resection of a mediastinal tumour that was found invading the carina. This was performed in a young patient who underwent carinal reconstruction using a novel technique combining cross-table ventilation and robotic-assisted surgery. © The Author 2024.

"Amivantamab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET bispecific antibody approved for certain patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR variant. Cutaneous toxicities are known on-target effects of EGFR inhibition. This article describes the occurrence and management of cutaneous toxicities in patients whose disease progressed on platinum chemotherapy treated with amivantamab. Post hoc analysis evaluated incidence, severity, and time to first onset of rash and paronychia. Five nurses and advanced practice providers were interviewed. Of 380 patients, 296 (78%) experienced treatment-related rash and/or paronychia. Paronychia (43%), rash (36%), and dermatitis acneiform (35%) were most frequent, with scalp rash reported by 17%. Treatment modifications because of rash and paronychia were infrequent. Nurses and advanced practice providers collaborate with physicians to manage cutaneous toxicities by administering comedications, modifying amivantamab dose, and educating patients."
"The risk of treatment-related toxicities with programmed cell death 1 and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in patients with lung cancer is unclear and inconclusive. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched without language restrictions from inception to May 31, 2024 to identify Phase 3 randomized controlled trials of lung cancer comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors versus placebo/best supportive care (alone or in combination with nontargeted chemotherapy) that had available data regarding treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) or incidence and sample size. Random-effect models were employed to study the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Finally, 36 trials, involving 19,693 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly augmented the likelihood of developing all-grade (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, p < .01) and grade ≥3 TRAEs (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.23, p < .01). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors substantially augmented the odds of developing treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.71, p < .01) and fatal adverse events (FAEs) (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.82, p < .01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the RR of SAEs and FAEs were generally consistent, regardless of treatment type, tumor type, treatment setting, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors type and study design. The most common causes of FAEs were respiratory failure/insufficiency (33.3%), cardiac events (16.1%), and hematological disorders (10.1%). We demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were significantly correlated with higher possibility of developing treatment-related toxicities, especially SAEs and FAEs, compared with placebo/best supportive care controls. © 2024 UICC."
"Surgical resection is the best-known approach for breast cancer treatment. However, post-operative metastases increase the rate of death. The potential effect of anesthetic drugs on long-term tumor growth, risk of metastasis, and recurrence after surgery has been investigated in cancer patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the anti-metastatic effect of lidocaine combined with common anesthetics and its mechanisms of action on lung metastasis in breast cancer models. The combination of lidocaine with propofol or sevoflurane inhibited the growth of TNBC cells compared to treatment alone. In addition, the combination effectively inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. It suppressed tumor growth and increased the survival rate in breast 4 T1 orthotopic models. More importantly, it inhibited lung metastasis and recurrence compared with groups treated with a single anesthetic. In co-culture with TAMs and TNBC cells, lidocaine not only reduced M2-tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that were increased by sevoflurane or propofol but also increased M1 macrophage polarization, impeding tumor growth in TNBC. Also, we found that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) derived from TAMs increased EMT signaling in TNBC cells, and that lidocaine affected cancer cells as well as M2-TAMs, inducing M2 to M1 reprogramming and decreasing TGF-β/Smads-mediated EMT signaling in TNBC cells, leading to inhibition of cancer metastasis and recurrence. These findings suggest lidocaine combined with general anesthetics as a potential therapeutic approach for the inhibition of recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer patients undergoing curative resection.

"Being implicated in bone metastasis development, bone sialoprotein (BSP) expression is upregulated in patients with cancer. While BSP regulates cancer cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, to the best of our knowledge, the specific adhesive molecular interactions in metastatic bone disease remain unclear. The present study aimed to improve the understanding of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence of BSP and the integrin receptors αvβ3 and αvβ5 in BSP-mediated cancer cell adhesion. Human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), prostate cancer (PC-3) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; NCI-H460) cell lines were cultured on BSP-coated plates. Adhesion assays with varying BSP concentrations were performed to evaluate the effect of exogenous glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine-proline (GRGDSP) peptide and anti-integrin antibodies on the attachment of cancer cells to BSP.

"To explore how non-surgical esophageal cancer patients can identify high-risk factors for radiation-induced pneumonitis after receiving radiotherapy. We retrospectively included 228 esophageal cancer patients who were unable to undergo surgical treatment but received radiotherapy for the first time. By retrospective analysis and identifying potential risk factors for symptomatic radiation-induced pneumonitis (ie ≥grade 2), as well as delineating the affected lung as an area of interest on localized CT and extracting radiomics features, along with extracting dosimetric parameters from the affected lung area. After feature screening, patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets in a 7-to-3 ratio, and a prediction model was established using machine learning algorithms. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to validate the predictive performance of the model. A total of 54 cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis occurred in this study, with a total incidence rate of 23.68%. The results of multivariate analysis showed that the occurrence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was significantly correlated with the mean lung dose (MLD), esophageal PTVD90, esophageal PTVV50, V5, V10, V15, and V20 in patients. The machine learning prediction model constructed based on candidate prediction variables has a prediction performance interval between 0.751 (95% CI: 0.700-0.802) and 0.891 (95% CI: 0.840-0.942) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Among them, the RFM algorithm has the best prediction performance for radiation-induced pneumonitis, with 0.891 (95% CI: 0.840-0.942) and 0.887 (95% CI: 0.836-0.938) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The combination of localization CT radiomics features and diseased lung dosimetry parameters has good predictive value for radiation-induced pneumonitis in esophageal cancer patients after radiotherapy. Especially, the radiation-induced pneumonitis prediction model constructed using RF algorithm can be more effectively used to guide clinical decision-making in esophageal cancer patients. © 2024 Hu et al."
"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become the standard treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. However, NSCLC heterogeneity leads to differences in efficacy; thus, potential biomarkers need to be explored to predict the prognosis of patients. Recently, the prognostic importance of pre-treatment malnutrition and systemic inflammatory response in cancer patients has received increasing attention. In this study, clinical information from 363 NSCLC patients receiving EGFR-TKI treatment at our clinical center was used for analysis. High nutritional risk index (NRI) and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients (P < 0.05). Importantly, NRI and SIRI were the best combination models for predicting clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients and independent OS and PFS predictors. Moreover, a nomogram model was constructed by combining NRI/SIRI, sex, smoking history, EGFR mutation, TNM stage, and surgery treatment to visually and personally predict the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS of patients with NSCLC. Notably, risk stratification based on the nomogram model was better than that based on the TNM stage. NRI and SIRI were the best combination models for predicting clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients receiving EGFR-TKI treatment, which may be a novel biomarker for supplement risk stratification in NSCLC patients. © 2024.

"Lung cancer in Australia contributes 9% of all new cancer diagnoses and is the leading cause of cancer death and burden. Clinical practice guidelines provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for best practice management. We aimed to determine the extent of delivery of guideline-concordant treatment (GCT) and to identify modifiable variables influencing receipt of GCT and survival. Data was sourced from the Victorian Lung Cancer Registry (VLCR) in Victoria, Australia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient and disease characteristics according to treatment type: GCT versus non-GCT versus no/declined treatment. Statistical analyses included multiple logistic regression, multiple COX regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. 52% of patients were treated with GCT, 32.8% non-GCT and 15.2% declined or received no treatment. GCT treated patients were younger, never smoked, had no comorbidities, had better performance status, had early stage cancer, were discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting or had treatment at a higher volume hospital. Overall, patients that received GCT had a 24% lower risk of mortality compared to patients that received non-GCT. Modifiable variables impacting likelihood of receiving GCT included age, smoking status and treating hospital characteristics. Several modifiable variables were identified with positive impacts on survival including increased treatment of the elderly, smoking cessation, delivery of GCT, and treatment in higher volume hospitals. The measurement and reporting of delivery of GCT has positive impacts on survival and therefore merits consideration as an evidence-based quality indicator in the reporting of lung cancer quality and safety outcomes.

"Breast tissue markers are essential in localising tumours post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to breast-conserving surgery. However, due to the advancement in neoadjuvant therapies, greater efficacy in reducing tumour size increases the possibility of marker migration, potentially compromising surgical outcomes. We report a case of a 34-year-old woman with left breast invasive carcinoma, where the tissue marker, placed under ultrasound guidance before chemotherapy, migrated and was undetectable after eight chemotherapy cycles. The delay in surgery was resolved by identifying the marker in the left pectoral muscle using CT, though proximity to the lung prevented hook wire placement. Proposed migration mechanisms include the ""accordion effect"" and haematoma-induced displacement, highlighting the dynamic nature of breast tissue. Various imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and CT, have proven helpful for marker localisation. This case underscores the need for a deeper understanding of tissue dynamics and emphasises interdisciplinary communication to adapt treatment strategies. As medical knowledge continues to evolve, insights are needed to refine best practices in breast cancer management and radiological interventions. Copyright © 2024, Subramaniam et al."
"Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide, representing 10% of all cancer types, and is considered the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths. It usually metastasizes to the liver or lung. Para-aortic lymph node metastasis is considered a metastatic disease (stage 4) according to the AJCC and is considered a regional disease (stage 3) according to the JSCCR. Para-aortic lymph node metastases occur in about 1% of cases. Neoadjuvant CTH, followed by PALN, is the best option for metastatic para-aortic LNs in colorectal cancer patients. This study addresses the value of prophylactic para-aortic LN dissection among colon-rectal cancer patients (overtreatment protocol). This is a prospective study that included patients attending NCI, Cairo University, from December 2020 to December 2023 who were complaining of left colonic cancer or recto-sigmoid cancer and underwent left hemicolectomy, sigmoid colectomy, or LAR. All patients underwent formal mesenteric LN dissection and prophylactic para-aortic LN dissection. Among 60 patients who underwent colorectal surgery with prophylactic para-aortic LN dissection, 21 cases (35%) were in the descending colon, 22 cases (36.7%) were in the sigmoid colon, 11 cases (18.3%) were in the recto-sigmoid, and 6 cases (10%) were in the upper rectum. 55 cases (91.7%) were in grade 2, and 5 cases (8.3%) were in grade 3. Neoadjuvant CTH was given in 3 cases (5%) while neoadjuvant RTH was given in 6 cases (10%). Regarding reported postoperative complications, lymphorrhea was reported in 2 patients (3.3%) and wound infection occurred in 6 patients (10%). A recurrence was reported among 8 cases (13.4%). We aimed in this study to highlight the value of prophylactic para-aortic lymph node dissection among colorectal cancer patients (over-treatment protocol) and report its reflection on predicting the behavior of the disease and subsequently selecting the patients who will be suitable to do this procedure. © 2024.

"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase has been implicated in the uncontrolled cell growth associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This has prompted the development of 3 generations of EGFR inhibitors over the last 2 decades due to the rapid development of drug resistance issues caused by clinical mutations, including T790M, L858R and the double mutant T790M & L858R. In this work we report the design, preparation and biological assessment of new irreversible 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-based inhibitors of EGFR kinase. Twenty new compounds have been prepared and evaluated which incorporate a range of electrophilic moieties. These include acrylamide, 2-chloroacetamide and (2E)-3-phenylprop-2-enamide, to allow reaction with residue Cys797. In addition, more polar groups have been incorporated to provide a better balance of physical properties than clinical candidate Rociletinib. Inhibitory activities against EGFR wildtype (WT) and EGFR T790M & L858R have been evaluated along with cytotoxicity against EGFR-overexpressing (A549, A431) and normal cell lines (HepG2).

"Dishevelled, EGL-10 and pleckstrin domain-containing 1 (DEPDC1) has been identified as a crucial factor in the development and progression of various types of cancer. This protein, which is largely undetectable in normal tissues but is highly expressed in numerous tumor types, serves a significant role in cell mitosis, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, DEPDC1 is implicated in several key signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival. The expression of DEPDC1 has been linked to poor prognosis and survival rates in multiple types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Notably, DEPDC1 has been suggested to have potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, as well as a therapeutic target. Its involvement in critical signaling pathways suggests that targeting DEPDC1 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, thereby improving patient outcomes. In addition, clinical trials have shown promising results for DEPDC1-derived peptide vaccines, indicating their safety and potential efficacy in cancer treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review addressing the role of DEPDC1 in cancer. Through a critical analysis of existing studies, the present review aimed to consolidate existing knowledge and highlight gaps in understanding, paving the way for future research to elucidate the complex interactions of DEPDC1 in the context of cancer biology.

"Cutaneous malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer and thus, a high mortality has been reported over decades. The prognosis for melanoma varies widely based on several factors, including the stage at which it is diagnosed, the location and thickness of the tumor, the patient's age and overall health, and specific genetic factors associated with melanoma. Therapeutic options include checkpoint inhibitors, regardless of V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B status (BRAF), and targeted therapy (anti-BRAF) in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but predicting which patients will benefit from these therapies remains challenging. Biomarkers like leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, platelets, and other peripheral blood biomarkers have been investigated for their potential to predict responses to ICIs. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) have emerged as potential biomarkers for predicting responses to ICIs. Elevated baseline levels of ctDNA and elevated sPD-L1 levels have been associated with worse prognosis in melanoma patients. High TMB is often associated with better responses to ICIs in melanoma. Here we present a case from our department, of a 57-year-old patient, diagnosed in 2019 with stage IV - pT4cNx cM1 (lymph nodes metastases) and suspicion of lung metastases, BRAF wild-type right hallux malignant melanoma. Due to impressive results, first-line treatment with ICIs nivolumab and ipilimumab was the preferred treatment of choice, which showed a favorable response, with regression of oncological disease after the first cycle, and achieving complete response afterward. Unfortunately, the treatment was discontinued due to severe hepatic and pancreatic toxicity, but the favorable response to immunotherapy has been maintained for four years and is ongoing. Identifying predictive biomarkers is important to achieve the best response for the patient, with minimal adverse events, especially if long-term clinical benefit can be reached.

"The effect of cancer in women has varied effects. Overall malignancies of the breast, cervix, and ovary account for over 43% of all cancer cases in India. Globally, cervical cancer is fourth cancer in terms of incidence among women, following breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. However, this illness primarily affects women in India, where it is the second most frequent malignancy after breast cancer. HPV-related cervical cancer is a serious public health issue that has a solution. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global initiative to eliminate cervical cancer which set targets for three important strategies: HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and treatment. The WHO's ""Best Buys"" recommendations for cancer sub-set place vaccination of females between the ages of 9 and 14 at the top of the list. In India, efforts are underway to increase the number of teenage girls receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The nation granted licenses for bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccinations in 2008, and in 2018, a nonavalent vaccine was approved. It is important to keep in mind that the cervical carcinoma vaccination is not a quick fix; thus, screening for the disease should continue. Any nation can potentially significantly lower the incidence of cervical cancer by carefully combining economical, high-coverage vaccinations with well-organized screening programs. Since 9-14 years is the ideal age range before sexual debut in today's world, this is the key vaccine age range. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness for younger adolescents, those between the ages of 9 and 14 years, varied from roughly 74 to 93%. Let us envision an India of the future where girls grow up with one fewer cancer threatening their life and a place where cervical cancer has been eradicated. © Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India 2024."
"Capmatinib is a selective MET inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in a phase II study of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring METex14 mutations. However, the real-world outcomes of capmatinib are largely unknown. From June 2019, the French Early Access Program (EAP) provided capmatinib to METex14 NSCLC patients who were ineligible for or for whom first-line standard therapies had failed. IFCT-2104 CAPMATU was a multicenter study that included all METex14 NSCLC patients who received capmatinib as part of the EAP until August 2021. The primary endpoints were time to treatment failure (TTF), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). A total of 146 patients were included. The median age was 74.9 years, 56.6 % were never-smokers, and 32.4 % had brain metastases. The median TTF, median PFS and median OS from capmatinib initiation were 5.1 months (95 % CI 4.2-6.0), 4.8 months (95 % CI 4.0-6.0) and 10.4 months (95 % CI 8.3-13.2), respectively. Evaluation of the best response to capmatinib was available for 134 patients and resulted in an ORR of 55.3 % (95 % CI 46.8 %-63.6 %). The median PFS was 7.7 months for treatment-naïve patients and 6.0 and 4.1 months for patients who had received one or 2 + prior lines of treatment, respectively. For patients with brain metastases, the median PFS was 3.0 months. Capmatinib had a known and manageable safety profile, with grade 3 to 4 adverse events, mostly peripheral edema (8.2 %), occurring in 17.8 % of patients. In this large real-world study of METex14 NSCLC patients, the efficacy of capmatinib was confirmed, with a manageable safety profile, even in patients with brain metastases and in those who received several lines of treatment. This study reinforces the key role of capmatinib for these patients. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"As more treatments emerge for advanced, stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), oncologists have difficulty predicting functional resiliency versus functional decline throughout cancer treatment. Our study evaluates functional resilience among patients with advanced NSCLC. Functional status was evaluated through 12 months of follow-up based on disability score using the modified EQ-5D-5L (mEQ-5D-5L) survey. Participants were classified into 4 groups: functional maintenance, decline, resilient, or variable. Characteristics of 207 participants with newly diagnosed NSCLC included demographics, comorbidities, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), mEQ-5D-5L scores, psychological symptoms, and lung cancer-specific symptoms. Treatment toxicity and grade were recorded. Resilience was defined as improvement from baseline disability scores. A 1-point increase in functional status score represents a 0.5 standard deviation change on the mEQ-5D-5L. Differences between the 4 groups were determined through Fisher's exact test or ANOVA. Kaplan-Meier curves describe overall survival (baseline through 18 months) stratified by baseline mEQ-5D-5L scores. Among participants, 42.0 % maintained functional status, 37.7 % experienced functional decline, 10.6 % were resilient, and 9.7 % had variable functional status. Participants with the best baseline function (score of 0) had the longest overall survival and participants with the worst baseline function (score of 5 + ) had the shortest overall survival. Among the healthiest patients, early score increases indicated shorter overall survival. Baseline ECOG PS was not associated with overall survival (p = 0.47). Baseline functional status may help better predict functional resiliency and overall survival than ECOG PS among patients receiving treatment for advanced NSCLC. Copyright © 2024.

"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of lung cancer and improved lung cancer survival in trials, but its real-world impact at the population level remains unclear. Using data obtained from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries from 2004 through 2019, we addressed the long-term trends in the incidence, incidence-based mortality (IBM), and survival of lung cancer patients in the United States. The incidence and IBM of both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) all significantly decreased steadily from 2004 to 2019. The 1-year survival (1-YS) of both NSCLC and SCLC improved over time, with the best improvement observed for Stage 4 NSCLC. Two significant turning points of Stage 4 NSCLC 1-YS were observed over the years: 0.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33%-0.93%) from 2004 to 2010, 0.81% (95% CI: 0.41%-1.21%) from 2010 to 2014 and a striking 2.09% (95% CI: 1.70%-2.47%) from 2014 to 2019. The same two turning points in 1-YS were pronounced for Stage 4 NSCLC in women, which were coincident with the introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and immunotherapy. However, for Stage 4 NSCLC in men, only one significant turning point in the 1-YS starting in 2014 was found, which might only correspond to immunotherapy. Significant period effects in reduced IBM were also observed for both Stage 4 AD and Stage 4 SQCC during the period. This SEER analysis found that immunotherapy improved the survival of Stage 4 NSCLC patients at the population level in the United States. This real-world evidence confirms that immunotherapy has truly revolutionized the management of lung cancer. © 2024 The Author(s).

"The Onco Summit 2023: The Latin American (LATAM) Chapter took place over two days, from 19-20 May 2023, in Brazil. The event aimed to share the latest updates across various oncology disciplines, address critical clinical challenges, and exchange best practices to ensure optimal patient treatment. More than 30 international and regional speakers and more than 300 oncology specialists participated in the Summit. The Summit discussions centered on common challenges and therapeutic advances in cancer care, with a specific focus on the unique obstacles faced in LATAM and examples of adaptable strategies to address these challenges. The Summit also facilitated the establishment of a network of oncologists, hematologists, and scientists in LATAM, enabling collaboration to improve cancer care, both in this region and globally, through drug development and clinical research. This report summarizes the key discussions from the Summit for the global and LATAM oncology community."
"The advent of immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of non-small cell lung (NSCLC) patients. However, given its low response rate and high cost of treatment, the search for valuable predictive markers of treatment efficacy is necessary. Considering the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumour and tumour microenvironment, the construction of a multi-dimensional prediction model is necessary. Therefore, we aimed to integrate clinical parameters, radiomic features, and immune signature data from NSCLC patients receiving immunotherapy to construct a multi-dimensional prediction model to better predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. The current study enrolled 137 NSCLC patients who received immunotherapy. We collected baseline clinical information, CT images, and tumour tissue specimens. Using 3D-Slicer software, radiomic features were extracted from patient CT images, and tumor tissue samples obtained before immunotherapy were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was applied to downscale the data, and the radiomic features and immune signatures associated with the prognosis of immunotherapy patients were identified. The modified lung immune predictive index (mLIPI), radiomics score (Radioscore), immune score and multi-dimensional model nomogram were constructed. The C-index and area under the curve (AUC) were applied to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the models. Three radiomic features and three immune signatures that could predict the efficacy of immunotherapy were eventually screened. Multivariate analysis showed that the mLIPI, Radioscore, and immune score were independent predictive factors for PFS and OS (P < 0.05 for all models). The multi-dimensional model combining the three models showed better predictive efficacy than the mLIPI, Radioscore, and immune score (PFS: 0.721 vs. 0.662 vs. 0.610 vs. 0.610; OS: 0.727 vs. 0.661 vs. 0.601 vs. 0.602 respectively). The multi-dimensional model showed the best predictive efficacy, with C-index for PFS and OS higher than mLIPI, radioscore and immune score: 0.721 vs. 0.662 vs. 0.610 vs. 0.610 for PFS and 0.727 vs. 0.661 vs. 0.601 vs. 0.602 for OS, respectively. The AUC for the multi-dimensional model also performed better than those of the individual models: 0.771 vs. 0.684 vs. 0.715 vs. 0.711 for PFS and 0.768 vs. 0.662 vs. 0.661 vs. 0.658 for OS, respectively. The multi-dimensional model combining the three models had better predictive efficacy than any single model and was more likely to help provide patients personalized and precision medicine. © 2024.
