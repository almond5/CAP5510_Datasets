Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and its global 
burden has more than doubled over the past 25 years. The highest incidence 
regions for pancreatic cancer include North America, Europe and Australia, and 
although much of this increase is due to ageing worldwide populations, there are 
key modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer such as cigarette smoking, 
obesity, diabetes and alcohol intake. The prevalence of these risk factors is 
increasing in many global regions, resulting in increasing age-adjusted 
incidence rates for pancreatic cancer, but the relative contribution from these 
risk factors varies globally due to variation in the underlying prevalence and 
prevention strategies. Inherited genetic factors, although not directly 
modifiable, are an important component of pancreatic cancer risk, and include 
pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer genes, genes associated with hereditary 
pancreatitis, as well as common variants identified in genome-wide association 
studies. Identification of the genetic changes that underlie pancreatic cancer 
not only provides insight into the aetiology of this cancer but also provides an 
opportunity to guide early detection strategies. The goal of this Review is to 
provide an up-to-date overview of the established modifiable and inherited risk 
factors for pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer usually results in poor survival with limited options for 
treatment, as most affected individuals present with advanced disease. Early 
detection of preinvasive pancreatic neoplasia and identifying molecular 
therapeutic targets provide opportunities for extending survival. Although 
screening for pancreatic cancer is currently not recommended for the general 
population, emerging evidence indicates that pancreatic surveillance can improve 
outcomes for individuals in certain high-risk groups. Changes in the 
epidemiology of pancreatic cancer, experience from pancreatic surveillance, and 
discovery of novel biomarkers provide a roadmap for new strategies for 
pancreatic cancer risk assessment, early detection, and prevention.

This review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on factors, diagnosis, and 
treatment of pancreatic cancer, and aims to promote further research on this 
under-studied malignant tumor. At present, we urgently need to identify 
high-risk patients with precancerous diseases through screening approaches, so 
that medical professionals and the general public may better understand 
prevention strategies or early detection measures. Pancreatic cancer is a highly 
invasive malignant tumor with a fatal risk, mainly seen in men and older adults 
(60-85 years old). Pancreatic cancer is now increasingly observed in young 
patients. Because the disease has no early symptoms and can quickly invade 
surrounding tissues and organs, it is one of the deadliest cancers. With a view 
to identify the important factors for the development of pancreatic cancer, 
previous studies have found that smoking, alcohol, and chronic pancreatitis are 
considered high-risk factors. Recent studies have shown that abnormal metabolism 
of human microorganisms, blood type, and glucose and lipid levels are also 
important factors in the development of pancreatic cancer. Identifying early 
diagnosis options is an important way to improve detection and survival rates of 
pancreatic cancer. None of the many tumor markers associated with pancreatic 
cancer are highly specific, which also indicates further research is required to 
improve the early detection rate. Future directions in terms of treatment 
evaluating the relationship between the microbiology-free system and 
immunotherapy will bring a major breakthrough and is expected to bring exciting 
clinical applications in improving the life-cycle of pancreatic cancer patients.

This review aims to outline the most up-to-date knowledge of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma risk, diagnostics, treatment and outcomes, while identifying gaps 
that aim to stimulate further research in this understudied malignancy. 
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal condition with a rising incidence, 
predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in some regions. It 
often presents at an advanced stage, which contributes to poor five-year 
survival rates of 2%-9%, ranking firmly last amongst all cancer sites in terms 
of prognostic outcomes for patients. Better understanding of the risk factors 
and symptoms associated with this disease is essential to inform both health 
professionals and the general population of potential preventive and/or early 
detection measures. The identification of high-risk patients who could benefit 
from screening to detect pre-malignant conditions such as pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous 
cystic neoplasms is urgently required, however an acceptable screening test has 
yet to be identified. The management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is evolving, 
with the introduction of new surgical techniques and medical therapies such as 
laparoscopic techniques and neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, however this has 
only led to modest improvements in outcomes. The identification of novel 
biomarkers is desirable to move towards a precision medicine era, where 
pancreatic cancer therapy can be tailored to the individual patient, while 
unnecessary treatments that have negative consequences on quality of life could 
be prevented for others. Research efforts must also focus on the development of 
new agents and delivery systems. Overall, considerable progress is required to 
reduce the burden associated with pancreatic cancer. Recent, renewed efforts to 
fund large consortia and research into pancreatic adenocarcinoma are welcomed, 
but further streams will be necessary to facilitate the momentum needed to bring 
breakthroughs seen for other cancer sites.

Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy with poor prognosis and high mortality. The 
recent increase in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality has resulted in an 
increased number of studies on its epidemiology. This comprehensive and 
systematic literature review summarizes the advances in the epidemiology of 
pancreatic cancer, including its epidemiological trends, risk factors, risk 
prediction models, screening modalities, and prognosis. The risk factors for 
pancreatic cancers can be categorized as those related to individual 
characteristics, lifestyle and environment, and disease status. Several 
prediction models for pancreatic cancer have been developed in populations with 
new-onset diabetes or a family history of pancreatic cancer; however, these 
models require further validation. Despite recent progress in pancreatic cancer 
screening, the quantity and quality of related studies are also unsatisfactory, 
especially with respect to the identification of high-risk populations and 
development of effective screening modality. Apart from the populations with 
familial genetic risk and those at a high risk of sporadic pancreatic cancer, 
risk factors such as new-onset diabetes may be a new direction for timely 
intervention. We hope this work will provide new ideas for further prevention 
and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is mainly diagnosed at an advanced, often metastatic stage and 
still has a poor prognosis. Over the last decades, chemotherapy of metastatic 
pancreatic cancer (mPDAC) has proven to be superior to a mere supportive 
treatment with respect to both survival and quality of life. Recently, even 
sequential treatment of mPDAC could be established. Options for first-line 
treatment are combination chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX and 
gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel when the performance status of the patient is 
good. For patients with poorer performance status, gemcitabine single-agent 
treatment is a valid option. Recently, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has been 
demonstrated to improve progression-free survival when used as a maintenance 
treatment in the subgroup of patients with mPDAC and a BRCA1/-2 germ line 
mutation having received at least 16 weeks of platinum-based chemotherapy. This 
group of patients also benefits from platinum-based chemotherapy combinations. 
Therefore, the BRCA1/-2 stats should be examined early in patients with mPDAC 
even when the occurrence of these mutations is only about 5% in the general 
Caucasian population. After the failure of first-line treatment, patients should 
be offered a second-line treatment if their ECOG permits further treatment. 
Here, the combination of 5-FU/FA plus nanoliposomal irinotecan has shown to be 
superior to 5-FU/FA alone with respect to overall survival. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors like PD1/PD-L1 mAbs are particularly efficacious in tumors with high 
microsatellite instability (MSI-h). Limited data in mPDACs shows that only a 
part of the already small subgroup of MSI-H mPDACs (frequency about 1%) appears 
to benefit substantially from a checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The 
identification of further subgroups, e.g., tumors with DNA damage repair 
deficiency, gene fusions, as well as novel approaches such as 
tumor-organoid-informed treatment decisions, may further improve therapeutic 
efficacy.

Pancreatic cancer is a growing source of cancer related death, yet has poor 
survival rates which have not improved in the last few decades. Its high 
mortality rate is attributed to pancreatic cancer biology, difficulty in early 
diagnosis and the lack of standardised international guidelines in assessing 
suspicious pancreatic masses. This review aims to provide an update in the 
current state of play in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and to evaluate the 
benefits and limitations of available diagnostic technology. The main modalities 
discussed are imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 
endoscopic ultrasound and positron emission tomography and tissue acquisition 
with fine needle aspiration. We also review the improvements in the techniques 
used for tissue acquisition and the opportunity for personalised cancer 
medicine. Screening of high risk individuals, promising biomarkers and common 
mimickers of pancreatic cancer are also explored, as well as suggestions for 
future research directions to allow for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer. 
Timely and accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer can lead to improvements in 
the current poor outcome of this disease.

Despite tremendous gains in the molecular understanding of exocrine pancreatic 
cancer, the prognosis for this disease remains very poor, largely because of 
delayed disease detection and limited effectiveness of systemic therapies. Both 
incidence rates and mortality rates for pancreatic cancer have increased during 
the past decade, in contrast to most other solid tumor types. Recent 
improvements in multimodality care have substantially improved overall survival, 
local control, and metastasis-free survival for patients who have localized 
tumors that are amenable to surgical resection. The widening gap in prognosis 
between patients with resectable and unresectable or metastatic disease 
reinforces the importance of detecting pancreatic cancer sooner to improve 
outcomes. Furthermore, the developing use of therapies that target 
tumor-specific molecular vulnerabilities may offer improved disease control for 
patients with advanced disease. Finally, the substantial morbidity associated 
with pancreatic cancer, including wasting, fatigue, and pain, remains an 
under-addressed component of this disease, which powerfully affects quality of 
life and limits tolerance to aggressive therapies. In this article, the authors 
review the current multidisciplinary standards of care in pancreatic cancer with 
a focus on emerging concepts in pancreatic cancer detection, precision therapy, 
and survivorship.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, and has a 
poor, five-year survival rate of 5%. Although complete surgical resection is the 
only curative therapy for pancreatic cancer, less than 20% of newly-diagnosed 
patients undergo surgical resection with a curative intent. Due to the lack of 
early symptoms and the tendency of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to invade adjacent 
structures or to metastasize at an early stage, many patients with pancreatic 
cancer already have advanced disease at the time of their diagnosis and, 
therefore, there is a high mortality rate. To improve the patient survival rate, 
early detection of PC is critical. The diagnosis of PC relies on computed 
tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance 
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or biopsy or fine-needle aspiration using 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Although multi-detector row computed tomography 
currently has a major role in the evaluation of PC, MRI with MRCP facilitates 
better detection of tumors at an early stage by allowing a comprehensive 
analysis of the morphological changes of the pancreas parenchyma and pancreatic 
duct. The diagnosis could be improved using positron emission tomography 
techniques in special conditions in which CT and EUS are not completely 
diagnostic. It is essential for clinicians to understand the advantages and 
disadvantages of the various pancreatic imaging modalities in order to be able 
to make optimal treatment and management decisions. Our study investigates the 
current role and innovative techniques of pancreatic imaging focused on the 
detection of pancreatic cancer.

Despite considerable research efforts, pancreatic cancer is associated with a 
dire prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. Early symptoms of the 
disease are mostly nonspecific. The premise of improved survival through early 
detection is that more individuals will benefit from potentially curative 
treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) methodology has emerged as a successful 
tool for risk stratification and identification in general health care. In 
response to the maturity of AI, Kenner Family Research Fund conducted the 2020 
AI and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Virtual Summit 
(www.pdac-virtualsummit.org) in conjunction with the American Pancreatic 
Association, with a focus on the potential of AI to advance early detection 
efforts in this disease. This comprehensive presummit article was prepared based 
on information provided by each of the interdisciplinary participants on one of 
the 5 following topics: Progress, Problems, and Prospects for Early Detection; 
AI and Machine Learning; AI and Pancreatic Cancer-Current Efforts; Collaborative 
Opportunities; and Moving Forward-Reflections from Government, Industry, and 
Advocacy. The outcome from the robust Summit conversations, to be presented in a 
future white paper, indicate that significant progress must be the result of 
strategic collaboration among investigators and institutions from 
multidisciplinary backgrounds, supported by committed funders.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal condition with a rising incidence and often 
presents at an advanced stage, contributing to abysmal five-year survival rates. 
Unspecific symptoms and the current lack of biomarkers and screening tools 
hamper early diagnosis. New technologies for liquid biopsies and their 
respective evaluation in pancreatic cancer patients have emerged over recent 
years. The term liquid biopsy summarizes the sampling and analysis of 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), and tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) from body fluids. The major advantages of liquid biopsies rely on 
their minimal invasiveness and repeatability, allowing serial sampling for 
dynamic insights to aid diagnosis, particularly early detection, risk 
stratification, and precision medicine in pancreatic cancer. However, liquid 
biopsies have not yet developed into a new pillar for clinicians' routine 
armamentarium. Here, we summarize recent findings on the use of liquid biopsy in 
pancreatic cancer patients. We discuss current challenges and future 
perspectives of this potentially powerful alternative to conventional tissue 
biopsies.

Pancreatic cancer is a common gastrointestinal malignancy, and is often 
associated with a poor prognosis. Challenges to effective screening for 
pancreatic cancer include low disease prevalence and high cost of screening 
modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging. Further, 
most patients are asymptomatic during the early course of disease, which often 
leads to delay in diagnosis. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, 
and palliative care.

Familial Pancreatic Cancer.

Benzel J, Fendrich V.

Familial pancreatic cancer accounts for 10% of all patients with pancreatic 
cancer. Because the 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is only 7%, 
screening programs for high-risk individuals are essential and might be 
advantageous. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mostly shows symptoms at an 
advanced state and treatment is not efficient enough to cure most patients. 
People with hereditary tumor syndromes or their affected relatives can also be 
included in such screening programs. Besides the collection of data to 
investigate the background of the disease, these screening programs aim to 
diagnose and treat precursor lesions so that more dangerous, invasive lesions 
are prevented. These precursor lesions can be pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, and mucinous cystic 
neoplasm. This review summarizes the latest knowledge of pancreatic screening 
programs, shows the procedure of pancreatic cancer screening, and gives an 
overview of current guidelines.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) carries a poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival 
of less than 10%. Early diagnosis, though cumbersome, is essential to allow 
complete surgical resection. Therefore, primary and secondary prevention are 
critical to reduce the incidence and to potentially prevent mortality. Given a 
relatively low lifetime risk of developing PC, identification of high-risk 
individuals is crucial to allow identification of pre-malignant lesions and 
small, localized tumors. Although 85-90% of PC cases are sporadic, we could 
consider risk stratification for the 5-10% of patients with a family history and 
the 3-5% of cases due to inherited genetic syndromes. These high-risk 
populations should be considered for screening and surveillance of PC. MRI/MRCP 
and EUS are the preferred modalities, due to their high sensitivity in lesion 
detection. Surveillance should be personalized, considering genetics and family 
history, and assessment of risk factors that may increase cancer risk. Screening 
programs should be limited to tertiary referral center, with high-volumes and 
adequate facilities to manage these patients.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a deadly disease and early detection through 
screening is likely to be our best hope to improve survival. Considering the low 
incidence of PC, population-based screening is not feasible, but is advisable 
for high-risk patients. Screening individuals at high risk for developing PC 
leads to the detection of premalignant lesions. High-grade pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are the 
targets for early detection of PC. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic 
resonance imaging are considered the most accurate techniques for pancreatic 
imaging; in particular EUS has emerged as a promising imaging test given its 
potential for tissue sampling to obtain diagnosis and to provide material for 
molecular profiling of PC. At the moment, screening should be performed within 
research protocols at experienced centers with a specific clinical and research 
interest, where a multidisciplinary team of specialists is available.

Pancreatic cancer poses a challenge in healthcare and is one of a leading cause 
of cancer-related mortality. In 2021, around 1,000 new cases were diagnosed in 
Denmark. The disease itself is associated with a poor prognosis. Partly due to 
its silent nature and partly due to the lack of sensitive and specific tumour 
markers for early detection. The five-year survival rate among patients with 
pancreatic cancer in Denmark is 5-6%. I this review, we describe the current 
diagnostic and treatment options as well as the status on cancer-predictive 
biomarkers and their screening potential.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers, mostly due to late 
diagnosis and limited treatment options. Early detection of pancreatic cancer in 
high-risk populations bears the potential to greatly improve outcomes, but 
current screening approaches remain of limited value despite recent 
technological advances. This review explores the possible advantages of liquid 
biopsies for this application, particularly focusing on circulating tumour cells 
(CTCs) and their subsequent single-cell omics analysis. Originating from both 
primary and metastatic tumour sites, CTCs provide important information for 
diagnosis, prognosisÂ and tailoring of treatment strategies. Notably, CTCs have 
even been detected in the blood of subjects with pancreatic precursor lesions, 
suggesting their suitability as a non-invasive tool for the early detection of 
malignant transformation in the pancreas. As intact cells, CTCs offer 
comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, epigeneticÂ and proteomic information that 
can be explored using rapidly developing techniques for analysing individual 
cells at the molecular level. Studying CTCs during serial sampling and at 
single-cell resolution will help to dissect tumour heterogeneity for individual 
patients and among different patients, providing new insights into cancer 
evolution during disease progression and in response to treatment. Using CTCs 
for non-invasive tracking of cancer features, including stemness, metastatic 
potentialÂ and expression of immune targets, provides important and readily 
accessible molecular insights. Finally, the emerging technology of ex vivo 
culturing of CTCs could create new opportunities to study the functionality of 
individual cancers at any stage and develop personalised and more effective 
treatment approaches for this lethal disease.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer worldwide, with an 
overall survival rate of 4.9%. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is essential 
for timely treatment and survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides 
advanced models and algorithms for better diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore AI models used for the prediction and 
early diagnosis of pancreatic cancers as reported in the literature.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted and reported in line with the PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension 
for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, 
BioRXiv, and MedRxiv were explored to identify relevant articles. Study 
selection and data extraction were independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data 
extracted from the included studies were synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: Of the 1185 publications, 30 studies were included in the scoping 
review. The included articles reported the use of AI for 6 different purposes. 
Of these included articles, AI techniques were mostly used for the diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer (14/30, 47%). Radiological images (14/30, 47%) were the most 
frequently used data in the included articles. Most of the included articles 
used data sets with a size of <1000 samples (11/30, 37%). Deep learning models 
were the most prominent branch of AI used for pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the 
studies, and the convolutional neural network was the most used algorithm 
(18/30, 60%). Six validation approaches were used in the included studies, of 
which the most frequently used approaches were k-fold cross-validation (10/30, 
33%) and external validation (10/30, 33%). A higher level of accuracy (99%) was 
found in studies that used support vector machine, decision trees, and k-means 
clustering algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: This review presents an overview of studies based on AI models and 
algorithms used to predict and diagnose pancreatic cancer patients. AI is 
expected to play a vital role in advancing pancreatic cancer prediction and 
diagnosis. Further research is required to provide data that support clinical 
decisions in health care.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year overall 
survival of less than 6%. Due to its insidious clinical course and unspecific 
symptoms, the diagnosis is usually late, with only 15-20% patients presenting 
with potentially curable disease. It is, therefore, extremely important to 
identify patients with PC at early stages of the disease when tumors may be 
amenable to surgical resection. For unresectable and borderline resectable PC it 
is consensual to perform a biopsy to have a cyto/histological confirmation of 
malignancy before treatment. However, for patients presenting with promptly 
resectable disease, the role of biopsy is more debatable. There are, in the 
literature, arguments both for and against the usefulness of a preoperative 
biopsy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an important technique assisting in the 
diagnosis and staging of PC. EUS-guided tissue acquisition is a well-established 
tool to demonstrate the malignant nature of a pancreatic lesion. This review 
focuses on the role of EUS in the diagnosis and staging of PC, and highlights 
the controversy related to the role of EUS-guided tissue acquisition in the 
preoperative assessment of patients presenting with promptly resectable tumors 
(early PC).

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy 
that is increasingly common. Screening for pancreatic cancer is not well 
established but might increase the chance of detection in early stages.
SUMMARY: We conducted a literature search to summarize current recommendations 
and to give an overview of patient groups that may benefit from screening. In 
the general population, screening is not recommended because the low prevalence 
of PDAC renders any diagnostic tests non-predictive and because there is no 
direct evidence that links early diagnosis to improved survival. To date, novel 
approaches like liquid biopsies and molecular markers are not yet able to 
improve screening in unselected individuals but offer promising potential. 
Screening efficiency increases considerably with increasing pretest probability. 
Therefore, the best way to improve early diagnosis is identifying high-risk 
individuals.
KEY MESSAGES: There are well-defined populations with distinct genetic 
alterations with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Those may be screened 
with common diagnostic methods. In addition, new-onset diabetes is increasingly 
recognized as an early symptom, especially in elderly patients with weight loss.

Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) at an early stage with curative surgery is 
the approach with the potential to significantly improve long-term patient 
outcome. Recently, some reports showed that patients with pancreatic tumors 
smaller than 10 mm showed a favorable prognosis. However, the rate of tumor 
detection on computed tomography in patients with small pancreatic tumors is 
low. For the diagnoses of PC with tumors smaller than 10 mm, the rate of tumor 
detection was higher on endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) than on computed 
tomography or other modalities, and histologic diagnosis using EUS-guided 
fine-needle aspiration was helpful in confirming the diagnosis. For the 
diagnosis of PC in situ, EUS and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may 
play important roles in detecting the local irregular stenosis of the pancreatic 
duct. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and sequential cytodiagnosis using 
pancreatic juice obtained by endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage multiple times 
was useful in the final diagnosis of PC in situ. At present, improving survival 
lies in identifying those individuals with high-risk factors or precursor 
lesions through an effective screening method. For example, these should include 
ultrasonography, various biological markers, or national familial pancreatic 
cancer registration. Additionally, the relationship between specialists in PC 
from medical centers and practicing physicians plays an important role in the 
early diagnosis of PC.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death 
and with a dismal 5-year survival of 10%. Poor survival of pancreatic cancer is 
mostly due to its presentation and diagnosis at a late stage. The present 
article aims to update clinicians with recent progress in the field of early 
detection of pancreatic cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pancreatic cancer screening is not recommended in the general 
population due to its low prevalence. In this review, we discuss high-risk 
groups for pancreatic cancer, including inherited predisposition to pancreatic 
cancer, new-onset diabetes, mucinous pancreatic cyst, and chronic pancreatitis. 
We discuss methods of enrichment of high-risk groups with clinical models using 
electronic health records and biomarkers. We also discuss improvements in 
imaging modalities and emerging role of machine learning and artificial 
intelligence in the field of imaging and biomarker to aid in early 
identification of pancreatic cancer.
SUMMARY: There are still vast challenges in the field of early detection of 
pancreatic cancer. We need to develop noninvasive prediagnostic validated 
biomarkers for longitudinal surveillance of high-risk individuals and imaging 
modalities that can identify pancreatic cancer early.

Pancreatic carcinoma.

The management of patients with pancreatic carcinoma poses many problems. The 
diagnosis is usually made late, generally because the patients present late, but 
it is not unusual to find patients who have had many negative investigations for 
vague upper abdominal symptoms only to be diagnosed as having pancreatic 
carcinoma many months later. Staging the disease is equally difficult and often 
inaccurate. The results of treatment are to date discouraging even in those 
patients diagnosed early. But the outlook is not totally dismal; in recent years 
the results for surgical resection of pancreatic lesions have improved; adjuvant 
treatment may finally be having an effect, although small, on this relentless 
disease. The most notable inroad made in the management of pancreatic cancer in 
the last 10 years is the improvement in palliation due to the use of the 
endoprosthesis. In spite of the poor results we must continue to search actively 
for more accurate methods of diagnosis and better methods of treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced stage, 
incurable disease. However, patients with high-grade precancerous lesions and 
many patients with low-stage disease can be cured with surgery, suggesting that 
early detection has the potential to improve survival. While serum CA19.9 has 
been a long-standing biomarker used for pancreatic cancer disease monitoring, 
its low sensitivity and poor specificity have driven investigators to hunt for 
better diagnostic markers.
AREAS COVERED: This review will cover recent advances in genetics, proteomics, 
imaging, and artificial intelligence, which offer opportunities for the early 
detection of curable pancreatic neoplasms.
EXPERT OPINION: From exosomes, to circulating tumor DNA, to subtle changes on 
imaging, we know much more now about the biology and clinical manifestations of 
early pancreatic neoplasia than we did just five years ago. The overriding 
challenge, however, remains the development of a practical approach to screen 
for a relatively rare, but deadly, disease that is often treated with complex 
surgery. It is our hope that future advances will bring us closer to an 
effective and financially sound approach for the early detection of pancreatic 
cancer and its precursors.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with a high mortality rate. 
The difficulty of early diagnosis is one of its primary causes. Therefore, we 
aimed to discover non-invasive biomarkers that facilitate the early diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer risk.
METHODS: The study subjects were randomly selected from the Korean Cancer 
Prevention Study-II and matched by age, sex, and blood collection point 
[pancreatic cancer incidence (nâ=â128) vs. control (nâ=â256)]. The baseline 
serum samples were analyzed by non-targeted metabolomics, and XGBoost was used 
to select significant metabolites related to pancreatic cancer incidence. 
Genomewide association study for the selected metabolites discovered valuable 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Moderation and mediation analysis were 
conducted to explore the variables related to pancreatic cancer risk.
RESULTS: Eleven discriminant metabolites were selected by applying a cut-off of 
4.0 in XGBoost. Five SNP presented significance in metabolite-GWAS 
(pââ¤â5âÃâ10-6) and logistic regression analysis. Among them, the pair metabolite 
of rs2370981, rs55870181, and rs72805402 displayed a different network pattern 
with clinical/biochemical indicators on comparison with allelic carrier and 
non-carrier. In addition, we demonstrated the indirect effect of rs59519100 on 
pancreatic cancer risk mediated by Î³-glutamyl tyrosine, which affects the 
smoking status. The predictive ability for pancreatic cancer on the model using 
five SNPs and four pair metabolites with the conventional risk factors was the 
highest (AUC: 0.738 [0.661-0.815]).
CONCLUSIONS: Signatures involving metabolites and SNPs discovered in the present 
research may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer 
and for use as predictive biomarkers allowing early pancreatic cancer diagnosis 
and therapy.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly neoplasms and the seventh major 
cause of cancer-related deaths among both males and females. This cancer has a 
poor prognosis due to the lack of appropriate methods for early detection of 
cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found to influence the 
progression and initiation of pancreatic cancer. MACC1-AS1, LINC00976, 
LINC00462, LINC01559, HOXA-AS2, LINC00152, TP73-AS1, XIST, SNHG12, LUCAT1, and 
UCA1 are among the oncogenic lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, 
LINC01111, LINC01963, DGCR5, MEG3, GAS5, and LINC00261 are among tumor 
suppressor lncRNAs in this tissue. In the current review, we summarize the roles 
of these two classes of lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer and discuss their potential 
as attractive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. We 
also identified that the low expression of MEG3, LINC01963, and LINC00261 and 
the high expression of MACC1-AS1, LINC00462, LINC01559, and UCA1 were 
significantly correlated with worse survival in pancreatic cancer patients. 
Further research on these lncRNAs will provide new clues that could potentially 
improve the early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and personalized treatments 
of patients with pancreatic cancer.

What Makes a Pancreatic Cancer Resectable?

of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.

The majority of patients with localized pancreatic cancer who undergo surgery 
with or without adjuvant therapy will develop metastatic disease, suggesting 
that surgery alone is not sufficient for cure and micrometastases are present at 
the time of diagnosis even when not clinically apparent. As such, the field is 
rapidly moving to consensus on treatment sequencing, which emphasizes the early 
delivery of systemic therapy and the application of surgery to the population of 
patients most likely to receive clinical benefit from such large 
operations-namely, those with stable or responding disease following systemic 
therapy and often chemoradiation. There remains incomplete consensus about the 
definition of what is operable (both tumor anatomy and patient 
age/comorbidities) and whether the operation should be performed in a 
high-volume center by more experienced surgeons. In this article, we try to 
provide a comprehensive description of when surgery should be performed and what 
constitutes an operable tumor. Such information is critically important for the 
optimal delivery of stage-specific therapy and to allow physicians to provide 
accurate expectations to all patients for treatment outcome. The complex issues 
of where and by whom such large operations should be performed is beyond the 
scope of this review.

Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) at an early stage with curative surgery 
should improve long-term patient outcome. At present, improving survival should 
lie in identifying those cases with high-risk factors or precursor lesions 
through an effective screening including ultrasonography, some biological 
markers, or national familial pancreatic cancer registration. Recently, cases 
with PCÂ <Â 10Â mm with a favorable prognosis have been reported. For the diagnoses 
of cases with PCÂ <Â 10Â mm, the rate of tumor detection was higher on endoscopic 
ultrasonography (EUS) than on CT or other modalities, and EUS-guided fine needle 
aspiration was helpful in confirming the histologic diagnosis. Additionally, for 
the diagnosis of cases with PC in situ, EUS and magnetic resonance 
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may play important roles in detecting the local 
irregular stenosis of the pancreatic duct. Cytodiagnosis of pancreatic juice 
using endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage multiple times may be useful in the 
final diagnosis.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Early 
detection is challenging because symptoms are relatively nonspecific. Imaging is 
vital in detecting and staging pancreatic tumors, and management depends on 
imaging findings. Radiologists should be aware of current surgical treatments 
for pancreatic neoplasms, as surgeons rely on interpretation of cross-sectional 
imaging for presurgical planning. Understanding postsurgical anatomy is critical 
to assess for complications and recurrence. This review will emphasize the role 
of the radiologist in planning for surgery and will review postoperative changes 
based on surgical intervention and common complications.

Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extremely high mortality and poor 
prognosis and is projected to be the leading cause of cancer deaths by 2030. Due 
to the lack of early symptoms and appropriate methods to detect pancreatic 
carcinoma at an early stage as well as its aggressive progression, the disease 
is often quite advanced by the time a definite diagnosis is established. The 
5-year relative survival rate for all stages is approximately 8%. Therefore, 
detection of pancreatic cancer at an early surgically resectable stage is the 
key to decrease mortality and to improve survival. The traditional methods for 
diagnosing pancreatic cancer involve an imaging test, such as ultrasound or 
magnetic resonance imaging, paired with a biopsy of the mass in question. These 
methods are often expensive, time consuming, and require trained professionals 
to use the instruments and analyze the imaging. To overcome these issues, 
biosensors have been proposed as a promising tool for the early diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer. The present review critically discusses the latest 
developments in biosensors for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Protein 
and microRNA biomarkers of pancreatic cancer and corresponding biosensors for 
pancreatic cancer diagnosis have been reviewed, and all these cases demonstrate 
that the emerging biosensors are becoming an increasingly relevant alternative 
to traditional techniques. In addition, we discuss the existing problems in 
biosensors and future challenges.

Sporadic pancreatic cancer amounts to â¼90% of all pancreatic cancers. It is a 
gloomy depressive disease and the most recalcitrant malignancy, with a very low 
5-year survival (3-6%). At present, diagnostic methods are commonly applied, as 
used half a century ago, after the appearance of local and systemic symptoms 
(abdominal and back pain, cholestasis, painless jaundice, fatigue, anorexia, 
weight loss, anemia, peripheral phlebitis, and cachexia). Unfortunately, these 
symptoms are harbingers of an advanced disease. The subsequent imaging methods 
may offer additional information on the location, size, and morphology of the 
lesion, but they do not influence the prognosis. Radical surgery may be offered 
to 15-20% of patients. The relapses after surgery are frequent and chemotherapy 
may be palliative. Preventive programs represent the only possibility of 
improvement. We propose the first multistep and multidisciplinary preventive 
program for early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer for the differential 
identification of average-risk patients who probably have the disease from those 
who do not.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive and lethal neoplasm, ranking seventh in 
the world for cancer deaths, with an overall 5-year survival rate of below 10%. 
The knowledge about PC pathogenesis is rapidly expanding. New aspects of tumor 
biology, including its molecular and morphological heterogeneity, have been 
reported to explain the complicated ""cross-talk"" that occurs between the cancer 
cells and the tumor stroma or the nature of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma-associated neural remodeling. Nevertheless, currently, there are 
no specific and sensitive diagnosis options for PC. Vibrational spectroscopy 
(VS) shows a promising role in the development of early diagnosis technology. In 
this review, we summarize recent reports about improvements in spectroscopic 
methodologies, briefly explain and highlight the drawbacks of each of them, and 
discuss available solutions. The important aspects of spectroscopic data 
evaluation with multivariate analysis and a convolutional neural network 
methodology are depicted. We conclude by presenting a study design for systemic 
verification of the VS-based methods in the diagnosis of PC.

While great strides in improving survival rates have been made for most cancers 
in recent years, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the 
solid tumors with the worst prognosis. PDAC mortality often overlaps with 
incidence. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment, but it 
can be performed in a very limited number of cases. In order to improve the 
prognosis of PDAC, there are ideally two possible ways: the discovery of new 
strategies or drugs that will make it possible to treat the tumor more 
successfully or an earlier diagnosis that will allow patients to be operated on 
at a less advanced stage. The aim of this review was to summarize all the 
possible strategies available today for the early diagnosis of PDAC and the 
paths that research needs to take to make this goal ever closer. All the most 
recent studies on risk factors and screening modalities, new laboratory tests 
including liquid biopsy, new imaging methods and possible applications of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning were reviewed and commented on. 
Unfortunately, in 2022 the results for this type of cancer still remain 
discouraging, while a catastrophic increase in cases is expected in the coming 
years. The article was also written with the aim of highlighting the urgency of 
devoting more attention and resources to this pathology in order to reach a 
solution that seems more and more unreachable every day.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignancies. Recent studies 
indicate that patients with incidentally diagnosed PC have better prognosis than 
those with symptoms and that there is a sufficient window for early detection. 
However, effective early diagnosis remains difficult and depends mainly on 
imaging modalities and the development of screening methodologies with highly 
sensitive and specific biomarkers. This review summarizes recent advances in 
effective screening for early diagnosis of PC using imaging modalities and novel 
molecular biomarkers discovered from various ""omics"" studies including genomics, 
epigenomics, non-coding RNA, metabonomics, liquid biopsy (CTC, ctDNA and 
exosomes) and microbiomes, and their use in body fluids (feces, urine and 
saliva). Although many biomarkers for early detection of PC have been discovered 
through various methods, larger scale and rigorous validation is required before 
their application in the clinic. In addition, more effective and specific 
biomarkers of PC are urgently needed.

The development of effective tools for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, 
or its precursors, in high-risk subjects could play a key role in reducing the 
burden of this disease, which is the most lethal among solid gastrointestinal 
tumors. Given the poor accessibility of the pancreas due to its anatomic site, 
and given the limitations of imaging modalities, biomarker screening might be a 
promising diagnostic option. This review focuses on the rationale of using stool 
markers for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, and systematically 
summarizes current evidence. Despite several potential advantages of stool 
testing for pancreatic cancer and its biological plausibility, only six studies 
investigating two genetic markers in stool (the K-ras and the p53 gene) could be 
identified. Even though these studies were limited in size and could hardly 
approximate the screening setting, both markers appear to lack sensitivity and, 
in particular, specificity. The investigation of further marker candidates 
(e.g., epigenetic markers) in adequately designed studies represents an 
important next step to explore the potential of stool testing for pancreatic 
cancer. Pertinent studies could greatly benefit from recent methodological 
advances gained in connection with stool testing for colorectal cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose at an early stage and generally has a 
poor prognosis. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment 
for pancreatic carcinoma. To improve the prognosis of this disease, it is 
essential to detect tumors at early stages, when they are resectable. The 
optimal approach to screening for early pancreatic neoplasia has not been 
established. The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening Consortium has 
recently finalized several recommendations regarding the management of patients 
who are at an increased risk of familial pancreatic cancer. In addition, there 
have been notable advances in research on serum markers, tissue markers, gene 
signatures, and genomic targets of pancreatic cancer. To date, however, no 
biomarkers have been established in the clinical setting. Advancements in 
imaging modalities touch all aspects of the clinical management of pancreatic 
diseases, including the early detection of pancreatic masses, their 
characterization, and evaluations of tumor resectability. This article reviews 
strategies for screening high-risk groups, biomarkers, and current advances in 
imaging modalities for the early detection of resectable pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to be the second leading 
cause of cancer death in the US by 2030. There are multiple germline pathogenic 
variants and cancer syndromes associated with an increased risk of PDAC. 
Precision treatment, informed by germline genetic testing and molecular tumor 
analysis, can optimize therapeutic regimens and outcomes for those diagnosed 
with PDAC. As a result, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently 
recommends genetic testing for all newly diagnosed PDAC patients given the 
clinical implications for treatment but also for the identification of at-risk 
family members who can benefit from pancreatic cancer screening and other cancer 
prevention strategies. This article reviews inherited risk factors for the 
development of PDAC and current screening strategies for the early detection of 
PDAC in high-risk populations.

The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor compared to other cancers. 
One of the reasons for this is the difficulty of early diagnosis. Surveillance 
using cancer biomarkers and image diagnosis can enable early detection and has 
improved the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. However, it is very 
difficult to detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage using cancer biomarkers 
and image diagnosis alone. Fucosylation is one of the most important types of 
glycosylation involved in cancer and inflammation. We have developed a novel 
glycocancer biomarker, fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt), and have investigated 
its usefulness for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer over approximately 10 
years. Recently, we also found that most pancreatic tissues surrounding 
pancreatic cancer exhibit chronic pancreatitis with fibrosis and/or fatty 
degeneration. Certain forms of chronic pancreatitis might indicate high risk for 
the development of pancreatic cancer. In this review, we provide a historical 
summary of our research on Fuc-Hpt as a cancer biomarker, and discuss a 
potential early detection system for pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal disease that can only be cured by 
complete surgical resection. However, most patients with PC have unresectable 
disease at the time of diagnosis, highlighting the need to detect PC and its 
precursor lesions earlier in asymptomatic patients. Screening is not 
cost-effective for population-based screening of PC. Individuals with genetic 
risk factors for PC based on family history or known PC-associated genetic 
syndromes, however, can be a potential target for PC screening programs. This 
article provides an overview of the epidemiology and genetic background of 
familial PC and discusses diagnostic and management approaches.

Pancreatic cancer is a disease associated with a poor overall survival. Advances 
in surgical techniques have helped improve outcomes of patients who are amenable 
to surgical resection. Sadly, surgery is amenable in only a small percentage of 
patients with the disease. Thus, there is a need to direct efforts at reducing 
the overall risk of pancreatic cancer or facilitating its early detection. The 
current review focused on collating all the literature published to date on 
pancreatic cancer in Australia with an aim to identify opportunities for 
intervention (at a state or national level) that are specific to Australia so as 
to help improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal 
cancers, and developing an efficient and reliable approach for its early-stage 
diagnosis is urgently needed. Precancerous lesions of PDAC, such as pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms 
(IPMN), arise through multiple steps of driver gene alterations in KRAS, TP53, 
CDKN2A, SMAD4, or GNAS. Hallmark mutations play a role in tumor initiation and 
progression, and their detection in bodily fluids is crucial for diagnosis. 
Recently, liquid biopsy has gained attention as an approach to complement 
pathological diagnosis, and in addition to mutation signatures in cell-free DNA, 
cell-free RNA, and extracellular vesicles have been investigated as potential 
diagnostic and prognostic markers. Integrating such molecular information to 
revise the diagnostic criteria for pancreatic cancer can enable a better 
understanding of the pathogenesis underlying inter-patient heterogeneity, such 
as sensitivity to chemotherapy and disease outcomes. This review discusses the 
current diagnostic approaches and clinical applications of genetic analysis in 
pancreatic cancer and diagnostic attempts by liquid biopsy and molecular 
analyses using pancreatic juice, duodenal fluid, and blood samples. Emerging 
knowledge in the rapidly advancing liquid biopsy field is promising for 
molecular profiling and diagnosing pancreatic diseases with significant 
diversity.

Familial pancreatic cancer--status quo.

INTRODUCTION: Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is defined by families with at 
least two first-degree relatives with confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) that do not fulfill the criteria of other inherited tumor syndromes with 
an increased risk for the development of PDAC, such as hereditary pancreatitis 
or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. FPC is mostly autosomal dominant 
inherited and presents with a heterogeneous phenotype. Although the major gene 
defect has not yet been identified, some important germline mutations in the 
BRCA2-, PALB2-, and ATM-genes are causative in some FPC families.
FPC SCREENING: It is suggested by experts to include high-risk individuals in a 
screening program with a multidisciplinary approach under research protocol 
conditions. However, neither biomarkers nor reliable imaging modalities for the 
detection of high-grade precursor lesions are yet available. Most screening 
programs are currently based on endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance 
imaging, and first data demonstrated that precursor lesions (pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) of PDAC can 
be identified. Timing and extent of surgery are still a matter of debate.
SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: The present review focuses on the clinical phenotype of 
FPC, its histopathological characteristics, known underlying genetic changes, 
genetic counseling, and screening.
